No Shame

[Intro]
 
E C Am
 
[Verse 1]
E
Angel, with the gun in your hand
            C                    Am
Pointin' my direction, givin' me affection
        E
Love is fatal
 
Won't you give it a chance?
          C
Center of attention
                     Am
Don't you ask me any questions
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
          E
Go on and light me like a cigarette
 
Even if it might be somethin' you regret
           C
You got me now, now, now
           Am
Swallow me down, down, down, down
 
 
[Chorus]
  E
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Am
Never enough and no satisfaction
C
Got no shame
Am
I love the way you're screaming my name
E
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Am
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
C
Got no shame
Am
I love the way you're screaming my name
 
 
[Verse 2]
E
Lay me in the palm of your hand
                    C                         Am
I'll give you my permission, you'll always be forgiven
       E
Go on, replace me
                                                        C
When you're cravin' somethin' sweeter than the words I left in your mouth
           Am
Go on and spit me out
 
 
[Chorus]
  E
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Am
Never enough and no satisfaction
C
Got no shame
Am
I love the way you're screaming my name
E
Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Am
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
C
Got no shame
Am
I love the way you're screaming my name
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
E C   Am
    I love the way you're screaming my name
E C   Am
    I love the way you're screaming my name

Go on and light me like a cigarette
 
Even if it might be somethin' you regret
           C
You got me now, now, now
           Am
Swallow me down, down, down, down
 
 
[Chorus]
  E
I only light up when cameras are flashin'
Am
Never enough and no satisfaction

Am
I love the way you're screaming my name

Diggin' my grave to get a reaction
Am
Changin' my face and callin' it fashion
C
Got no shame
Am
I love the way you're screaming my name
