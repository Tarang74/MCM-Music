Counting Stars

[Intro]
Am                 C
Lately, I've been, I've been losing sleep

Dreaming about the things that we could be
    Am               C
But baby, I've been, I've been praying hard,
G
Said, no more counting dollars

In my face is flashing signs
F
Seek it out and ye shall find

Old, but I'm not that old

Young, but I'm not that bold
G
I don't think the world is sold
F
I'm just doing what we're told

Am C                G
I feel something so right

Doing the wrong thing

Doing the right thing

I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
F
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
