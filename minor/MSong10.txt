Ready aim fire

[Chorus]
          Am                    C
With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
G                              D
Never quite thought we could loose it all
Am               C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
    G                D
An empire's falling just one day
      Am                   C
You close your eyes and the glory fades
G                D              Am             C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
G                D
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away 
 
[Verse]
Am                   C
Off in the distance, there is resistance
G                D
Bubbling up and festering
Am             C
Hey Mr Motion, make me a potion
G                        D
Shake it all up with your mystery
Am                                 C
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
G                         D
I know every single face 'round here
Am                   C
A man on a mission, changing the vision
G                   D
I was never welcome here
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                        F
We don't have a choice to stay
            Em                 F
We'd rather die than do it your way
 
[Chorus]
           Am                    C
With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
G                              D
Never quite thought we could loose it all
Am               C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
    G                D
An empire's falling just one day
      Am                   C
You close your eyes and the glory fades
G                D              Am             C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
G                D
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away
 
[Verse]
Am                  C
Back in the casing, shaking and pacing
G                    D
This is the tunnel's light
Am                    C
Blood in the writing, stuck in the fighting
G                         D
Look through the rifle's sight
Am                                 C
How come I've never seen your face 'round here?
G                        D
I know every single face 'round here
Am                  C
Here in the heckle, holding the shackle
G                   D
I was never welcome here
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Em                        F
We don't have a choice to stay
            Em                 F
We'd rather die than do it your way
 
[Chorus]
           Am                    C
With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
G                              D
Never quite thought we could loose it all
Am               C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
    G                D
An empire's falling just one day
      Am                   C
You close your eyes and the glory fades
G                D              Am             C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
G                D
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away
Em         F     (x4)
Woah
           Am                    C
With our backs to the wall, the darkness would fall
G                              D
Never quite thought we could loose it all
Am               C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire
    G                D
An empire's falling just one day
      Am                   C
You close your eyes and the glory fades
G                D              Am             C
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away (fire!)
G                D
Ready aim fire, Ready aim fire away
