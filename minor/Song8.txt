Bad Guy

[Intro]
Am  Dm  E
 
 
[Verse 1]
Am
White shirt now red, my bloody nose, sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Dm                                 E
Creepin' around like no one knows, think you're so criminal
Am
Bruises on both my knees for you, don't say thank you or please, I do
Dm                               E
What I want when I'm wanting to, my soul so cynical
 
 
[Chorus 1]
            Am
So you're a tough guy, like it really rough guy
 
Just can't get enough guy, chest always so puffed guy
         Dm
I'm that bad type, make your mama sad type
                     E
Make your girlfriend mad tight, might seduce your dad type
N.C.
I'm the bad guy, duh
 
 
[Post-Chorus 1]
Am          Dm      E
    I'm the bad guy
 
 
[Verse 2]
N.C.
I like it when you take control, even if you know that you don't
N.C.
Own me, I'll let you play the role, I'll be your animal
Am
My mommy likes to sing along with me, but she won't sing this song
Dm                                  E
If she reads all the lyrics, she'll pity the men I know
 
 
[Chorus 2]
            Am
So you're a tough guy, like it really rough guy
 
Just can't get enough guy, chest always so puffed guy
         Dm
I'm that bad type, make your mama sad type
                     E
Make your girlfriend mad tight, might seduce your dad type
N.C.
I'm the bad guy, duh
 
 
[Post-Chorus 2]
Am          Dm      E
    I'm the bad guy,  duh
Am                         Dm   E
    I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
 
 
[Interlude]
Am
   I like when you get mad
Am
   I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
Am
   You said she's scared of me, I mean
N.C.
I don't see what she sees but maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
 
 
[Outro]
Am
   I'm a bad guy
Am
   I'm a bad guy
Am
   Bad guy, bad guy, I'm a bad
