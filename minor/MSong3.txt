[Intro]
Am E
 
 
[Verse 1]
Am
Will you hold the line
 
When every one of them has given up and given in, tell me
  E
In this house of mine
 
Nothing ever comes without a consequence or cost, tell me
 Am
Will the stars align?
 
Will heaven step in? Will it save us from our sin? Will it?
  E
'Cause this house of mine stands strong
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                     Am
That's the price you pay
                                  E
Leave behind your heart and cast away
                           Am
Just another product of today
                               E
Rather be the hunter than the prey
 
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...
  
[Chorus]
 Am
Natural
 
A beating heart of stone
           E
You gotta be so cold
 
To make it in this world
                Am
Yeah, you're a natural
 
Living your life cutthroat
           E
You gotta be so cold
 
Yeah, you're a natural
 
[Verse 2]
 Am
Will somebody
 
Let me see the light within the dark trees shadowing
  E
What's happenin?
 
Lookin' through the glass find the wrong within the past knowin'
      Am
We are the youth
 
Cut untill it bleeds, inside a world without the peace, face it
   E
A bit of the truth, the truth
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                    Am
That's the price you pay
                                  E
Leave behind your heart and cast away
                           Am
Just another product of today
                               E
Rather be the hunter than the prey
 
And you're standing on the edge, face up 'cause you're a...
 
[Chorus]
Am
Natural
 
A beating heart of stone
           E
You gotta be so cold
 
To make it in this world
                Am
Yeah, you're a natural
 
Living your life cutthroat
           E
You gotta be so cold
 
Yeah, you're a natural
 
[Bridge] (picking)
  Am
Deep inside me, I'm fading to black, I'm fading
  E
Took an oath by the blood of my hand, won't break it
   Am
I can taste it, the end is upon us, I swear
  E
Gonna make it
 
I'm gonna make it
 
[Chorus]
Am
Natural
 
A beating heart of stone
           E
You gotta be so cold
 
To make it in this world
                Am

Living your life cutthroat
           E
You gotta be so cold
