Believer

[Verse 1]
Am                                                   F
First things first, I'ma say all the words inside my head
                 E                                 Am
I'm fired up and tired of the way that things have been, oh-ooh
                         F            E
The way that things have been, oh-ooh-ooh
Am                                                               F
Second thing second, don't you tell me what you think that I can be
                   E                          Am
I'm the one at the sail, I'm the master of my sea, oh-ooh
                 F           E
The master of my sea, oh-ooh-ooh
  
[Pre-Chorus]
      Am
I was broken from a young age, taking my sulking to the masses
              F                                     E
Write down my poems for the few, that looked at me, took to me, shook to me, feeling me
             Am
Singing from heartache, from the pain, take up my message from the veins
            F                                 E                 N.C.
Speaking my lesson from the brain, seeing the beauty through the...
 
[Chorus]
Am
Pain!
                               F         E
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Am
   Pain!
                                      F         E
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Am
Pain!
                                      F
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
   E                                      N.C.
My life, my love, my drive, they came from...
Am
Pain!
                               F         E
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
 
[Verse 2]
Am                                                F
Third things third, send a prayer to the ones up above
                         E                                 Am
All the hate that you've heard has turned your spirit to a dove, oh-ooh
                F            E
Your spirit up above, oh-ooh-ooh
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
      Am
I was choking in the crowd, building my rain up in the cloud
             F                              E
Falling like ashes to the ground, hoping my feelings, they would drown
         Am
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
                        F                      E     N.C.
Till it broke up and it rained down, it rained down, like...
 
[Chorus]
Am
Pain!
                               F         E
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Am
   Pain!
                                      F         E
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Am
Pain!
                                      F
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
   E                                      N.C.
My life, my love, my drive, they came from...
Am
Pain!
                               F         E
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
 
[Bridge]
Am                                                 F
Last things last, by the grace of the fire and the flames
                       E                       Am
You're the face of the future, the blood in my veins, oh-ooh
                F             E
The blood in my veins, oh-ooh-ooh
         F
But they never did, ever lived, ebbing and flowing, inhibited, limited
                        G                      E     N.C.
Till it broke up and it rained down, it rained down, like...
 
[Chorus]
Am
Pain!
                               F         E
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
Am
   Pain!
                                      F         E
You break me down, you build me up, believer, believer
Am
Pain!
                                      F
Oh, let the bullets fly, oh, let them rain
   E                                      N.C.
My life, my love, my drive, they came from...
Am
Pain!
                               F         E
You made me a, you made me a believer, believer
