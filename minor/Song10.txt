Without Me

[Verse 1]
Am          C
Found you when your heart was broke
G                 F
I filled your cup until it overflowed
        Am      C
Took it so far to keep you close (keep you close)
G              F
I was afraid to leave you on your own
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
       Am                  C
I said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
            G                    F
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
           Am                   C
And then I got you off your knees
 
Put you right back on your feet
         G                      F
Just so you could take advantage of me
 
 
[Chorus]
                  Am           C
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
          G                         F
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
                 Am              C
You know I'm the one who put you up there
            G                   F
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
                   Am   C
Thinking you could live without me
                   G    F
Thinking you could live without me
               Am              C
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
              G                 F
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
                   Am   C
Thinking you could live without me
G    F
Live without me
              Am              C
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
              G           F
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am       C
Gave love 'bout a hundred tries (hundred tries)
G                       F
  Just running from the demons in your mind
       Am         C
Then I took yours and made 'em mine (mine)
G                  F
  I didn't notice 'cause my love was blind
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         Am               C
Said I'd catch you if you fall (fall)
            G                    F
And if they laugh, then fuck 'em all (all)
           Am                    C
And then I got you off your knees
 
Put you right back on your feet
         G                       F
Just so you could take advantage of me
 
 
[Chorus]
                  Am           C
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
          G                         F
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
                 Am              C
You know I'm the one who put you up there
            G                   F
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
                   Am   C
Thinking you could live without me
                   G    F
Thinking you could live without me
               Am              C
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
              G                 F
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
                   Am   C
Thinking you could live without me
G    F
Live without me
              Am              C
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
              G           F
I don't know why (I don't know why, yeah, yeah)
 
 
[Bridge]
Am                   C
You don't have to say just what you did (what you did)
G                       F
I already know (I know)
                                 Am     C
I had to go and find out from them (oh-woah)
                     G        F
So tell me, how's it feel? (oh-woah)
 
 
[Chorus]
                  Am           C
Tell me, how's it feel sittin' up there?
           G                 F
Feeling so high, but too far away to hold me
                 Am              C
You know I'm the one who put you up there
            G                 F
Name in the sky, does it ever get lonely?
                   Am   C
Thinking you could live without me
                   G    F
Thinking you could live without me
              Am              C
Baby, I'm the one who put you up there
              G                 F
I don't know why (yeah, I don't know why)
