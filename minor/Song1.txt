[Chorus]
                    Am
I love it when you call me señorita

[Verse 1]
Am                                         C
Land in Miami, the air was hot from summer rains
                                             F
Sweat drippin' off me before I even knew her name, la-la-la
             Em            G
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah no
Am
Sapphire and moonlight, we danced for hours in the sand
C                                         F
Tequila sunrise, her body fit right in my hands, ooh-la-la-la
              Em             G
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
 
 
[Chorus]
                    Am
I love it when you call me señorita
                   C
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
                    F
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
 
It's true, la-la-la
  Em
Ooh, I should be runnin'
  G                              Am
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
                 C
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
                   F
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
 
It's true, la-la-la
 Em
Ooh, I should be runnin'
 G
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
 
 
[Verse 2]
Am                                                       C
Locked in the hotel, there's just somethings that never change
                                                               F
You say we're just friends, but friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la
          Em                                               G
'Cause ya know it's been a long time coming, don't ya let me fall, ooh
Am
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
C                               G
Ooh, love your kiss is deadly, don't stop
 
 
[Chorus]
                   Am
I love it when you call me señorita
                   C
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
                    F
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
 
It's true, la-la-la
  Em
Ooh, I should be runnin'
  G                              Am
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
                 C
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
                   F
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
 
It's true, la-la-la
 Em

Am                             C
All along I've been coming for ya (For you)
                                  F
And I hope it means something to you
                                 Em
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
            G
