Whatever it takes

[Intro]
Am   G

Em

Am   G

Em
 

[Verse 1]
Am
Falling too fast to prepare for this
G
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Em
Everybody circling is vulturous
 
Negative, Nepotist
Am
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
G
Everybody praying for the end of times
Em
Everybody hoping they could be the one
N.C.
I was born to run, I was born for this
  
[Pre-Chorus]
Am
Whip, whip
              G
Run me like a race horse
               D
Pull me like a rip cord
                  Em
Break me down and build me up
               Am
I wanna be the slip, slip
               G
Word upon your lip, lip
                D
Letter that you rip, rip
                  Em
Break me down and build me up
 
[Chorus]
            F    C
Whatever it takes
                  G              Am
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
                 F    C
I do whatever it takes
                    G                     Am
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            F    C
Whatever it takes
   G                      Am
Ya take me to the top, I’m ready for
            F    C
Whatever it takes
                  G
Cause I love the adrenaline in my 
N.C.
Veins. I do what it takes
 
[Verse 2]
Am
Always had a fear of being typical
G
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Em
Always hanging on to the visual
 
I wanna be invisible
Am
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
G
Everybody needs to be a part of ‘em
Em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
 
I was born to run, I was born for this
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am
Whip, whip
              G
Run me like a race horse
               D
Pull me like a rip cord
                  Em
Break me down and build me up
               Am
I wanna be the slip, slip
               G
Word upon your lip, lip
                D
Letter that you rip, rip
                  Em
Break me down and build me up
  
[Chorus]
            F    C
Whatever it takes
                  G              Am
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
                 F    C
I do whatever it takes
                    G                     Am
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            F    C
Whatever it takes
   G                      Am
Ya take me to the top, I’m ready for
            F    C
Whatever it takes
                  G
Cause I love the adrenaline in my 
N.C.
Veins. I do what it takes
 
[Bridge]
Am              G
Hypocritical, egotistical. Don’t wanna be the 
Em
Parenthetical, hypothetical, working onto 
Am                          G
something that I’m proud of out of the box an 
Em
Epoxy to the world and the vision we’ve lost. I'm an
Am                     G
Apostrophe, I’m just a symbol to reminds you that there’s 
Em
More to see. I’m just a product of the system, a 
   Am                  G
Catastrophe, and yet a masterpiece, and yet I’m
Em
Half diseased and when I am deceased, at least I 
Am                           G
Go down to the grave and die happily
          Em
Leave the body of my soul to be a part of thee
N.C.
I do what it takes
 
[Chorus]
            F    C
Whatever it takes
                  G              Am
Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
                 F    C
I do whatever it takes
                    G                     Am
Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
            F    C
Whatever it takes
   G                      Am
Ya take me to the top, I’m ready for
            F    C
Whatever it takes
                  G
Cause I love the adrenaline in my 
N.C.
Veins. I do what it takes
