Nothing left to say

[Intro]
Am F C G
 
[Verse]

Am                                 F
Who knows how long I've been awake now?
F                                 C
The shadows on my wall don't sleep
C
They keep calling me
G
Beckoning...
Am                                                F
Who knows what's right? The lines keep getting thinner
F                         C
My age has never made me wise
C                  G
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on
 
[Chorus]
Am
There's nothing left to say now
F
There's nothing left to say now
C
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
G
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
Am
There's nothing left to say now
F
There's nothing left to say now
C
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
G
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
 
[Verse]
Am                           F
Below my soul I feel an engine
F                           C
Collapsing as it sees the pain
C                  G
If I could only shut it out
Am                               F
I've come too far to see the end now
F                   C
Even if my way is wrong
C              G
I keep pushing on and on and on and on
 
[Chorus]
Am
There's nothing left to say now
F
There's nothing left to say now
C
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
G
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
Am
There's nothing left to say now
F
There's nothing left to say now
C
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
G
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
 
[Bridge]
Am                             F
I keep falling, I keep falling down
F                             C         G
I keep falling, I keep falling down
Am                             F
I keep falling, I keep falling down
F                             C
I keep falling, I keep falling down
C                   G
If you could only save me
G                                 Am
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul
 
[Chorus]
Am
There's nothing left to say now
F
There's nothing left to say now
C
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
G
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
Am
There's nothing left to say now
F
There's nothing left to say now
C
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
G
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now
 
[Outro]
