[Intro]
|Am  |G   |Dm  |Dm  | x4
 
 
[Verse 1]
Am         G                   Dm
   I don't want this night to end
       Am              G              Dm
It's closing time, so leave with me again, yeah
Am         G                Dm
   You got all my love to spend, oh
       Am                 G           Dm
Let's find a place where happiness begins
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
            Am                       G
We're gonna dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Dm
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ay)
     Am                        G
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Dm
Drunk to an 80s groove (Ay)
            Am                       G
We're gonna dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Dm
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Am                        G
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Dm
Drunk
 
 
[Chorus]
          Am    G                       Dm
It's only human when you know that it's real
                 Am                G                   Dm
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel?
                   Am      G                Dm
Oh babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
   Am                     G                     Dm
So stop pretending you're shy, just come on and dance, dance, dance, dance

[Verse 2]
N.C.                    Dm
   Early morning la-la-light
 Am          G                 Dm
Only getting up to close the blinds, oh
Am              G                      Dm
   I'm praying you don't change your mind
                                    Am
'Cause leaving now just don't feel right
       G              Dm
Let's do it one more time, oh babe
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
            Am                       G
We're gonna dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Dm
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Hurts when I'm leaving you)
     Am                        G
Just dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Dm
Drunk to an 80s groove (Ay)
            Am                       G
We're gonna dance in my living room, slave to the way you move
Dm
Hurts when I'm leaving you (Ayy)
Am                        G
Dance in the living room, love with an attitude
Dm
Drunk
 
 
[Chorus]
          Am    G                       Dm
It's only human when you know that it's real (Know that it's real)
                 Am                G                   Dm
So why would you fight or try to deny the way that you feel? (The way that you feel)
                   Am      G                Dm
Oh babe, you can't fool me, your body's got other plans
   Am                     G                     Dm
So stop pretending you're shy, just come on and dance, dance, dance, dance
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
Am     G         Dm
Oh    (Dance, oh)   woo, ay
        Am               G                 Dm
(Only human) It's only ('man), it's only ('man), only human
Am     G     Dm
          Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
        Am               G                 Dm
(Only human) It's only ('man), it's only ('man), only human
