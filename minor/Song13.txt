I Want It That Way

[Verse]
     Am     F C
You are my fire
     Am    F C
The one desire
     Am      F  C
Believe when I say
Am          G   C
I want it that way
    Am      F   C      Am
But we are two worlds apart
       F    C        Am
Can't reach to your heart
      F   C
When you say
     Am         G    C
That I want it that way
 
[Chorus]
         F
Tell me why
                    G     Am
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         F
Tell me why
                    G    Am
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         F
Tell me why
               G        C
I never wanna hear you say
Am         G    C
I want it that way
 
[Verse]
   Am     F C
Am I your fire
     Am     F C
Your one desire
      Am        F    C
Yes I know it's too late
    Am         G    C
But I want it that way
 
[Chorus]
         F
Tell me why
                    G    Am
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         F
Tell me why
                    G   Am
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         F
Tell me why
               G        C
I never wanna hear you say
Am         E
I want it that way
 
[Bridge]
Am                         C
Now I can see that we're falling apart
          F                  Dm    G
From the way that it used to be, yeah
     Am
No matter the distance
  C
I want you to know
      F                  G
That deep down inside of me...
 
[Verse]
    F      G Am
You are my fire
    F     G Am
The one desire
     F
You are
             G        C     Am       G
You are, you are, you are  (I want it....)
 
[Chorus]
G
  Don't wanna hear you (say)
G                    A   Bm
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
G                    A  Bm
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
G              A        D
I never wanna hear you say
Bm        A    D
I want it that way
 
[Chorus]
         G
Tell me why
                    A    Bm
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
         G
Tell me why
                    A  Bm
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         G
Tell me why
               A        D
I never wanna hear you say
Bm        A    D
I want it that way

Tell me why
                    A    Bm
Ain't nothin' but a heartache
                    A  Bm
Ain't nothin' but a mistake
         G
Tell me why
               A        D
I never wanna hear you say
Bm        A    D

Cause, I want it that way
