Monster
[Verse]
 
Am            C
 Ever since I could remember,
G            D
 Everything inside of me,
Am      C            G         D
 Just wanted to fit in (oh oh oh oh)
Am             C
 I was never one for pretenders,
G                 D
 Everything I tried to be,
Am       C              G       D
 Just wouldn't settle in (oh oh oh oh)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Am                C
 If I told you what I was,
G                          D
 Would you turn your back on me?
Am                 C
 And if I seem dangerous,
G                  D
 Would you be scared?
Am                   C
 I get the feeling just because,
   G                             D
 Everything I touch isn't dark enough
Am           C               G
 That this problem lies in me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
     Am         C            G            D
 I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
     Am             C         G             D
 I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
    Am         C
 A monster, A monster,
       G                D
 I've turned into a monster,
    Am         C
 A monster, A monster,
       G                   D
 And it keeps getting stronger.
 
 
[Verse]
 
Am         C
 Can I clear my conscience,
   G         D
 If I'm different from the rest,
Am      C                 G         D
 Do I have to run and hide? (oh oh oh oh)
Am          C
 I never said that I want this,
  G          D
 This burden came to me,
Am         C                   G        D
 And it's made it's home inside (oh oh oh oh)
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
Am               C
 If I told you what I was,
 G                     D
 Would you turn your back on me?
Am                C
 And if I seem dangerous,
 G                D
 Would you be scared?
Am                    C
 I get the feeling just because,
    G                            D
 Everything I touch isn't dark enough
Am           C             G
 That this problem lies in me
 
 
[Chorus]
 
      Am        C           G             D
 I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
      Am             C        G             D
 I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
    Am          C
 A monster, A monster,
       G                D
 I've turned into a monster,
    Am          C
 A monster, A monster,
       G                D
 And it keeps getting stronger.

 I'm only a man with a candle to guide me,
     Am           C           G             D
 I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me.
    Am          C
 A monster, A monster,
        G               D
 I've turned into a monster,
    Am          C
 A monster, A monster,
       G                    D
 And it keeps getting stronger.
