Im so sorry
[Verse 1]
 
Am              G                  D                Am
 About time for anyone telling you I throw all your deeds
Am            G                  D                 Am
 No sign, the roar and thunder, stopped in cold to read
Am              G
 I get mine and make no excuses
D                 Am
Waste of precious breath (No time)
Am                 G
 The sun shines on everyone
        D                Am
anyone, love yourself to death
 
[Chorus] 
                  Am                Em
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
                D                        Am
You'll never be loved till you make your own
               Am                Em
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
                      D                     Am
You'll never know the top 'till you get too low
Am
 Oh son of a
Am
 Stepfather

 Oh son of a
D
I'm so sorry

[Verse 2]
Am          G
No lies and no deceiving
D               Am
Men is what you lose
Am             G
 I keep trying to conceive
     D              Am
That death is from above (No time)
Am              G
 I get mine and make no excuses
D                 Am
Waste of precious breath (No time)
Am                 G
 The sun shines on everyone
        D                Am
anyone, love yourself to death
 
[Chorus]
                  Am                Em
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
                D                        Am
You'll never be loved till you make your own
               Am                Em
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
                      D                     Am
You'll never know the top 'till you get too low
Am
 Oh son of a

[Bridge]
F                          G
 Life isn't always what you think it'd be
F                                     G
 Turn your head for one second and the tables turn
F                         G
 And I know, I know that I did you wrong
F                                      G                     F
 Will you trust me when I say that I'll make it up to you somehow
    G
Somehow
 
[Chorus]
                  Am                Em
So you gotta fire up, you gotta let go
                D                        Am
You'll never be loved till you make your own
               Am                Em
You gotta face up, you gotta get yours
                      D                     Am
You'll never know the top 'till you get too low
Am
 Oh son of a
