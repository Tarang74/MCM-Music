L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
C                         F
Sundown and they all come out
F
Lamborginis and their rented Hummers
             Em                         Am
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
                                  C
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
                                   F
And they wanna know what you're about
F
Me in the middle with the one I'm lovin'
                Em                   Am
We're just tryna figure everything out
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                     C
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
F                                           Em
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
Am                      C
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
C                                    N.C.
This is my only fear, that we become
 
 
[Chorus]
                 Am
Beautiful people
Am
Drop top, designer clothes
C
Front row at fashion shows
F
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
F                 Em
Inside the world of beautiful people
Am
Champagne and rolled-up notes
C
Prenups and broken homes
    F
Surrounded, but still alone
F               Em
Let's leave the party
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
           Am             C
That's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
           F         Em
We are not beautiful
                 Am             C
Yeah, that's not who we are (We are, we are, we are)
           F                   Em
We are not beautiful (Beautiful)

N.C.                 C                                       F

      F                             Em           Am
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there (All night)
        C                                     F
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
               F                       Em
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am                    C
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
F                                           Em
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
Am                       C
