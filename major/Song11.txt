[Intro]
 
D F#m E          (2x)
 
[Verse 1]
 
D              F#m
Am I out of touch?
                 E
Am I out of my place?
                              E
When I keep saying That I'm looking for an empty space 
D                       F#m
Oh I'm wishing you were here
                         E
But I'm wishing you were gone
                          E
I can't have you and I'm only gonna do you wrong
D                      F#m
Oh I'm gonna mess this up
                    E
Oh this is just my luck
                   E
Over and over and over again
 
[Chorus]
A
I'm sorry for everything
 
Oh everything I've done
 
From the second that I was born
 
It seems I had a loaded gun
            F#m
And then I shot shot shot a hole through Everything I loved
        E
I shot shot shot a hole through
  E
Every single thing that I loved
 
[Instrumental]
D F#m E
 
[Verse 2]
 
D            F#m
Am I out of luck?
                 E
Am I waiting to break?
                    E
When I keep saying That I'm looking for a way to escape
D                F#m
Oh I'm wishing I had
                    E
What I'd taken for granted
                          E
I can't help you when I'm only gonna do you wrong
D                      F#m
Oh I'm gonna mess this up
                    E
Oh this is just my luck
                   E
Over and over and over again
 
[Chorus]
A
I'm sorry for everything
 
Oh everything I've done
 
From the second that I was born
 
It seems I had a loaded gun
            F#m
And then I shot shot shot a hole through Everything I loved
        E
I shot shot shot a hole through
  E
Every single thing that I loved 
 
[Post-Chorus]

[Bridge] 
A
In the mean timeWe let it goAt the road side that we used to know
D
We can let this drift awayOh we let this drift away
A
At the bayside where you used to showIn the moonlight where we let it go
D
We can let this drift awayOh we let this drift away
F#m
And there's always time to change your mindOh there's always time to change your mind
E
Oh love Can you hear me?Oh let it drift away
 
[Chorus]
A
I'm sorry for everything
 
Oh everything I've done
 
From the second that I was born
 
It seems I had a loaded gun
            F#m
And then I shot shot shot a hole through Everything I loved
        E
I shot shot shot a hole through
  E
Every single thing that I loved
A
In the mean time We let it go

At the road side that we used to know
A
We can let this drift away

Oh we let this drift away
F#m
At the bayside where you used to show

In the moonlight where we let it go
E
We can let this drift away

Oh we let this drift away
F#m
And there's always time to change your mind

Oh there's always time to change your mind
E
Oh love Can you hear me?
E
Oh let it drift away
