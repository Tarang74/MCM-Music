On top of the world

[Verse 1]
A
If you love somebody
D
Better tell them while they’re here ’cause
A                                  D
They may just run away from you 
A
You’ll never know what went well
D
Then again it just depends on
A                               D
How long of time is left for you
A
I’ve had the highest mountains
D
I’ve had the deepest rivers
A                                   D
You can have it all but life keeps moving
A                                  E
Now take it in but don’t look down
 
[Chorus]
                              D
‘Cause I’m on top of the world, ‘ay
                      A
I’m on top of the world, ‘ay
                        E
Waiting on this for a while now
                         Bm
Paying my dues to the dirt
                        D
I’ve been waiting to smile, ‘ay
                            A
Been holding it in for a while, ‘ay
                         E
Take it with me if I can
                                 Bm
Been dreaming of this since a child
                    A
I’m on top of the world
 
[Verse 2]
A
I’ve tried to cut these corners
D
Try to take the easy way out
A                             D
I kept on falling short of something 
A
I coulda gave up then but
D
Then again I couldn’t have ’cause
A                               D
I’ve traveled all this way for something 
A                               E
Now take it in but don’t look down
 
[Chorus]
                              D
‘Cause I’m on top of the world, ‘ay
                      A
I’m on top of the world, ‘ay
                        E
Waiting on this for a while now
                         Bm
Paying my dues to the dirt 
                        D
I’ve been waiting to smile, ‘ay
                            A
Been holding it in for a while, ‘ay
                         E
Take it with me if I can
                                 Bm
Been dreaming of this since a child
                    A
I’m on top of the world
 
(Interlude)
 
[Chorus]
                              D
‘Cause I’m on top of the world, ‘ay
                      A
I’m on top of the world, ‘ay
                        E
Waiting on this for a while now
                         Bm
Paying my dues to the dirt 
                        D
I’ve been waiting to smile, ‘ay
                            A
Been holding it in for a while, ‘ay
                         E
Take it with me if I can
                                 Bm
Been dreaming of this since a child
 
[Outro]
       D
And I know it’s hard when you’re falling down
           A
And it’s a long way up when you hit the ground
    E                   Bm
Get up now, get up, get up now 
       D
And I know it’s hard when you’re falling down
           A
And it’s a long way up when you hit the ground
    E                   Bm
Get up now, get up, get up now
