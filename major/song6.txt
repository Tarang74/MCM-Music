Its time

[Verse]
A
So this is what you meant when you said that you were spent?
E                                                                  F#m
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit right to the top,
  F#m
Don't hold back
D
Packing my bags and giving the academy a rain check
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A                                         E
I don't ever want to let you down
                                         F#m
I don't ever want to leave this town
             D
'Cause after all
D
This city never sleeps at night...
 
[Chorus]
A
It's time to begin, isn't it?
                    F#m
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
                                   Bm
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
                 D
Now don't you understand
 
That I'm never changing who I am?
 
[Instrumental]
A E F#m D
 

[Verse]
A
So this is where you fell, and I am left to sell
E
the path that heaven runs through miles of clouded hell, 
             F#m
right to the top
F#m
Don't look back
D
Turning to rags and give the commodities a rain check
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
I don't ever want to let you down
E                                F#m
I don't ever want to leave this town
              D
'Cause after all
D
This city never sleeps at night...
 
[Chorus]
A
It's time to begin, isn't it?
                     F#m
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
                                    Bm
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
                 D
Now don't you understand
D
That I'm never changing who I am?
A
It's time to begin, isn't it?
                     F#m
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
                                    Bm
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
                 D
Now don't you understand
D
That I'm never changing who I am?
 
[Bridge]
F#m                         E
This road never looked so lonely,
                              D
This house doesn't burn down slowly,
Bm            D
to ashes, to ashes...
 
[Chorus]
F#m
It's time to begin, isn't it?
                    E
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
                                    D
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Bm                D
Now don't you understand
D
That I'm never changing who I am?
F#m
It's time to begin, isn't it?
                    E
I get a little bit bigger, but then, 
                                    D
I'll admit, I'm just the same as I was
Bm                D
Now don't you understand
D
That I'm never changing who I am?
