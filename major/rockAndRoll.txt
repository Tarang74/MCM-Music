[Verse 1]
 
A
It’s been a long time since I rock and rolled
 
It’s been a long time since I did the stroll
        D
Ooh, let me get it back, let me get it back
                                         A
Let me get it back, baby, where I come from
E
It’s been a long time, been a long time
        D       A
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time. Yes it has

It’s been a long time since the book of love
 
I can’t count the tears of a lie with no love
D
Carry me back, carry me back,
A
Carry me back, baby, where I come from
E
It’s been along time, been a long time,
        D       A
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

[Verse 3]
 
A
Seems so long since we walked in the moonlight,
 
Making vows that just can’t walk right
D
Open your arms, open your arms
        A
Open your arms, baby, let my love come running in
E
It’s been a long time, been a long time,
        D       A
Been a long lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely time.

Ooo yeah… ooo yeah
