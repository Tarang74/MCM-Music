Birds

[Verse]
A          C#m
Two hearts, one valve
B                              B
Pumpin' the blood, we were the flood
 
We were the body and
A         C#m
Two lives, one life
B
Stickin' it out, lettin' you down
 
Makin' it right
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
Seasons, they will change
C#m
Life will make you grow
B                         B
Dreams will make you cry, cry, cry
A
Everything is temporary
C#m
Everything will slide
B
Love will never die, die, die
 
[Chorus]

I know that
A    C#m
Ooh,
B             B
 Birds fly in different directions
A    C#m
Ooh,
B
 I hope to see you again
 
[Verse]
A        C#m
Sunsets, sunrises
B                               B
Livin' the dream, watchin' the leaves

Changin' the seasons
A           C#m
Some nights I think of you
B
Relivin' the past, wishin' it'd last
 
Wishin' and dreamin'
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
Seasons, they will change
C#m
Life will make you grow
B                        B
Death can make you hard, hard, hard
A
Everything is temporary
C#m
Everything will slide
B
Love will never die, die, die
 
[Chorus]

I know that
A    C#m
Ooh,
B             B
 Birds fly in different directions
A    C#m
Ooh,
B
 I hope to see you again
A    C#m
Ooh,
B             B
 Birds fly in different directions
A    C#m
Ooh,
B
 So fly high, so fly high
 
[Bridge]
F#m      C#m               E     G#m
 When the moon is lookin' down
F#m         C#m                 E        G#m
 Shine that light up for your ground
F#m         C#m           E       G#m
 I'm flyin' up to let you see
F#m       C#m            E     B
 That the shadow cast is me
 
[Chorus]

I know that
A     C#m
Ooh,
B             B
 Birds fly in different directions
A     C#m
Ooh,
B
 I hope to see you again
A     C#m
Ooh,
B             B
 Birds fly in different directions
A     C#m
Ooh,
B
 So fly high, so fly high
 
[Outro]
A     C#m
Ooh,
B
 So fly high, so fly high
A     C#m
Ooh,
B              B
 So fly high, so fly high
