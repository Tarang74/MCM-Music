What A Man Gotta Do

[Intro]
 
A
 
[Verse 1]
A
Cut my heart about one, two times
 
Don't need to question the reason, I'm yours, I'm yours
  D
I know the others lose a fight just to see you smile
                  A
'Cause you got no flaws, no flaws
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         E
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
D                                    A
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, all yours
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A
So, what a man gotta do?
                 A
What a man gotta do?
      D                       A
To be totally locked up by you
                  A
What a man gotta say?
                  A
What a man gotta pray?
           D                                      A
To be your last good night and your first good day
                      A
So, what a man gotta do?
                 A
What a man gotta do?
      D                       A
To be totally locked up by you
                 A
What a man gotta do?
                  A
What a man gotta prove?
      D                       A
To be totally locked up by you
 
 
[Verse 2]
A
You ain’t trying to be wasting time
 
On stupid people and cheap lines, I'm sure, I'm sure
       D
So I'd give a million dollars just to go grab me by the collar
                   A
And lock up these doors, these doors
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
        E
I'm not tryin' to be your part-time lover
D                             A
Sign me up for the full-time, I'm yours, I'm yours, woo!
 
 
[Chorus]
                     A
So, what a man gotta do?
                 A
What a man gotta do?
      D                       A
To be totally locked up by you
                  A
What a man gotta say?
                  A
What a man gotta pray?
           D                                      A
To be your last good night and your first good day
                      A
So, what a man gotta do?
                 A

                  A
What a man gotta prove?
      D                       A
To be totally locked up by you
