We Found Love

[Verse 1]
 
F#m              D
Yellow diamonds in the light 
A                  E
And we're standing side by side 
F#m            D
As your shadow crosses mine 
A                E        F#m  D
What it takes to come aliiiivvveee..
 
A                        E             F#m  D
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't denyyyy 
A                      E
But I've gotta let it go

F#m                 D
We found love in a hopeless place 
A                  E
We found love in a hopeless place 
F#m                D
We found love in a hopeless place 
A                  E
We found love in a hopeless place 
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
F#m              D
Shine a light through an open door 
A                  E
Love and life I will divide 
F#m            D
Turn away cause I need you more 
A                E        F#m  D
Feel the heartbeat in my mind 
 
A                        E             F#m  D
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't denyyyy 
A                      E
But I've gotta let it go
