Thinking Out Loud

[Verse]
A                                               D             E
         When your legs don't work like they used to before
A                                           D    E
       And I can't sweep you off of your feet
A                                            D           E
      Will your mouth still remember the  taste of my love
A                                  D      E
    Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
 
            A                  D   E          A          D E
And darling I will be loving you till we're 70
            A                        D  E        A
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
D                         E
And I'm thinking bout how
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm                         E      A
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Bm                       E
Maybe just the touch of hand
     Bm                          E          F#m
Well me I fall in love with you every single day
    Bm                      E
And I just wanna tell you I am
            A
So honey now..
 
[Chorus]
D E                          A
   Take me into your loving arms
D E                            A
  Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
D            E                  A
  Place your head on my beating heart
             D    E
I'm thinking out loud
 
          F#m  E    D    A        Bm   E   A
And maybe we found love right where we are
 
[Verse]
 A                                               D           E
       And when my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
A                                     D     E
   And the crowds don't remember my name
         A                         D          E
            When my hands don't play the strings the same way
A                                           D     E
        I know you will still love me the same
 
           A                         D     E            A              D   E
Cause honey your soul could never grow old it's evergreen
           A                     D  E            A
And baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
D                E
And i'm thinking bout how
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Bm                        E       A
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Bm                         E
And maybe it's all part of plan
      Bm                      E     F#m
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistake
Bm                    E
Hoping that you'll understand
A
That baby now..
 
[Chorus]
D E                        A
Take me into your loving arms
D E                            A
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
D E                            A
Place your head on my beating heart
             D    E
I'm thinking out loud
 
[Interlude]
          F#m  E    D    A        Bm   E   A

A           D  E
A           D  E
A           D  E
 
[Chorus]
         A
So baby now
D E                        A
Take me into your loving arms
D E                            A
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
D E                            A
Place your head on my beating heart
             D    E
I'm thinking out loud
 
[Outro]
           F#m  E    D      A     Bm   E   A
That maybe we found love right where we are
     F#m  E    D      A      Bm   E   A
Baby we found love right where we are
     F#m  E    D   A       Bm   E   A
And we found love right where we are
