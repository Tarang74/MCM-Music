[Intro]
 
(Lead Guitar with percussion)
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
F#m                                       A
Ticking away the moments that make up a dull day
E                                          F#m
Fritter and waste the hours in an offhand way
F#m                                         A
Kicking around on a piece of ground in your hometown
E                                                 F#m
Waiting for someone or something to show you the way
 
 
[Chorus]
 
D                               A
Tired of lying in the sunshine, staying home to watch the rain
D                                   A
You are young and life is long, and there is time to kill today
D                              C#m
     And then one day you find,   ten years have got behind you
Bm                            E
No one told you when to run ... You missed the starting gun
 
 
[Guitar Solo]
 
F#m    A    E    F#m    x4
 
D      A      D      A      D      C#m   Bm   E
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
         F#m                                                A
And you run and you run to catch up with the Sun, but it's sinking;
E                                     F#m
Racing around to come up behind you again.
    F#m                                            A
The Sun is the same in a relative way, but you're older,
E                                         F#m
shorter of breath, and one day closer to death.
 
D                              A
Every year is getting shorter, never seem to find the time.
D                                    A
Plans that either come to naught, or half a page of scribbled lines.
D                         C#m
Hanging on in quiet desperation is the English way.
    Bm                                                    F
The time is gone, the song is over. Thought I'd something more to say.
