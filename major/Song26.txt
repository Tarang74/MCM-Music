You Need To Calm Down

[Intro]
|A   |A   |D   |D   |
 
 
[Verse 1]
A
You are somebody that I don't know
           A
But you're takin' shots at me like it's Patr√≥n
                   D              D
And I'm just like "Damn, it's 7 a.m."
A
Say it in the street, that's a knock-out
        A
But you say it in a tweet, that's a cop-out
                   D             D
And I'm just like "Hey, are you okay?"
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
    A                                                                    A
And I ain't tryna mess with your self-expression but I've learned the lesson
                                                       D
That stressin' and obsessin' 'bout somebody else is no fun
     E N.C.
And snakes and stones never broke my bones
 
 
[Chorus]
   A                           A
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                 D                      D
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
                  A                           A
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                  D                      D
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on my gown?
                 A    A
You need to calm down
 
 
[Verse 2]
A
You are somebody that we don't know
           A
But you're comin' at my friends like a missile
            D                      D
Why are you mad, when you could be GLAAD? (You could be GLAAD)
A
Sunshine on the street at the parade
    A
But you would rather be in the dark ages
             D                      D
Makin' that sign, must've taken all night
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
A                                                                  A
You just need to take several seats and then try to restore the peace
                                                          D
And control your urges to scream about all the people you hate
        E N.C.
'Cause shade never made anybody less gay
 
 
[Chorus]
   A                           A
So oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                 D                      D
You need to calm down, you're being too loud
                  A                           A
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                  D                      D
You need to just stop, like can you just not step on his gown?
                 A
You need to calm down
 
 
[Bridge]
 
And we see you over there on the internet
A
  Comparing all the girls who are killin' it
D                                     D
  But we figured you out, we all know now
           N.C.
We all got crowns, you need to calm down
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.
Oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                 D
You need to calm down (You need to calm down)
                 D
You're being too loud (You're being too loud)
                  A                           A
And I'm just like oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
                  D
You need to just stop (Can you stop?)
                  D
Like can you just not step on our gowns?
                 A
You need to calm down
