Walking the wire

[Intro]
A
[Verse 1]
       A
Do you feel the same when I'm away from you?
        D
Do you know the line that I'd walk for you?
          E
We could turn around, or we could give it up
          D                 D
But we'll take what comes, take what comes
        A
Oh the storm is raging against us now
           D
If you're afraid of falling then don't look down
        E
But we took the step, and we took the leap
           D               D
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     F#m
Feel the wind in your hair
      E
Feel the rush way up here
 
[Chorus]
                  A
We're walking the wire, love
                  D
We're walking the wire, love
                  F#m
We're gonna be higher, up
                   E
We're walking the wire, wire, wire
 
[Verse 2]
         A
There's nights we had to just walk away
            D
And there's tears we'll cry, but those tears will fade
          E
It's the price we pay when it comes to love
          D                D
And we'll take what comes, take what comes
 
[Pre-Chorus]
         F#m
Feel the wind in your hair
         E
Feel the rush way up here
 
[Chorus]
                  A
We're walking the wire, love
                  D
We're walking the wire, love
                  F#m
We're gonna be higher, up
                  E
We're walking the wire, wire, wire
 
[Bridge]
                A
So look out down below
              D
Look out down below
            F#m
Look out down below
            E
Walking the wire, wire, wire
                 A
So look out down below
 
[Verse 3]
      A
Oh, I'll take your hand when thunder roars
      D
And I'll hold you close, I'll stay the course
  E
I promise you from up above
           D                D
That we'll take what comes, take what comes, love
 
[Chorus]
                  A
We're walking the wire, love
                  D
We're walking the wire, love
                 F#m
We're gonna be higher, up
                  E
We're walking the wire, wire, wire
 
[Outro]
                A
So look out down below
              D
Look out down below
            F#m
Look out down below
            E
Walking the wire, wire, wire
                 A
So look out down below 
A D F#m E
