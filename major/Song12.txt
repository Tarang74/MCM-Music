[Verse 1]
          A        F#m
I found a love for me
              D                            E
Darling, just dive right in, and follow my lead
                A          F#m
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
        D                                     E
I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                                A
Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
            F#m                      D                A  E
Not knowing what it was, I will not give you up this ti-ime
             A                           F#m
Darling just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
            D                     E
And in your eyes you're holding mine
 
[Chorus]
      F#m   D             A          E              F#m
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
D                A     E                F#m
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
          D                A                 E              F#m
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
         D                A        E             A
But you heard it, darling you look perfect tonight

[Verse 2]
                A                    F#m
Well, I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
              D                                          E
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
           A             F#m
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
         D                              E
To carry love, to carry children of our own
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                             A                     F#m
We are still kids, but we're so in love, fighting against all odds
             D               A  E
I know we'll be alright this ti-ime
             A                              F#m
Darling just hold my hand, be my girl, I'll be your man
         D               E
I see my future in your eyes
 
[Chorus]
      F#m   D              A         E              F#m
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
D                A     E                F#m
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
        D                A                E
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
  F#m       D                  A        E          [ A ]
I don't deserve this, darling you look perfect tonight

I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met an angel

In person, and she looks perfect
