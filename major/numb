[Intro]
Em  C  G  D
Em  C  G  D
 
 
[Verse 1]
  Em                          C
I'm tired of being what you want me to be
   G                       D
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface
  Em                       C
Don't know what you're expecting of me
   G                        D              C      D
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes
 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       Em               G                C        D
Every step I take is another mistake to you
 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
 
 
[Chorus]
Em             C                      G
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               D                    Em
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             C                   G
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                D                   Em
Is be more like me and be less like you
 
 
[Verse 2]
                               C
Can't you see that you're smothering me
    G                  D             Em
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control
                             C
Cause everything that you thought I would be
       G           D                C        D
Has fallen apart right in front of you
 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
       Em                    G               C        D
Every step that I take is another mistake to you
 
(Caught in the undertow, just caught in the undertow)
             Em                       G       D
And every second I waste is more than I can take
 
 
[Chorus]
Em             C                      G
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               D                    Em
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             C                   G
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                D                   C
Is be more like me and be less like you
 
 
[Bridge]
Hint: starting with the C the bass tones should ascend till G/B and then go back down to C. The ascendance
of the bass tones is crucial for the intensification of this part.
 
        D
And I know
      Em D/F# G Bm7   C
I may end up failing too
        D
But I know
          B                        Bsus4
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you
 
 
[Chorus]
Em             C                      G
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
               D                    Em
I've become so tired, so much more aware
             C                   G
I'm becoming this, all I want to do
                D                   Em
Is be more like me and be less like you
               C                      G
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                          D
(Tired of being what you want me to be)
Em             C                      G
I've become so numb, I can't feel you there
                          D
(Tired of being what you want me to be)
 
 
[Outro]
Em  C  G  D
