[Intro]
A E F#m C#
 

[Verse 1]
     F#m               E
As a child, you would wait
    D                  C#
and watch from far away.
        F#m                     E
But you always knew that you'd be the one
  D              C#
that work while they all play.
   F#m           E
In youth, you'd lay,
 D                    C#
awake at night and scheme
   F#m                  E
of all the things that you would change,
    D                C#
but it was just a dream.
 
[Chorus]
F#m      A               D       C#
Here we are, don't turn away now,
F#m         A             D             C#
we are the warriors that built this town. 
F#m      A               D       C#
Here we are, don't turn away now,
F#m         A             D             C#
we are the warriors that built this town
     F#m
From dust
 
[Verse 2]
              E
The time will come,
            D          C#
when you'll have to rise
 F#m                 E
above the best, and prove yourself,
     D               C#
your spirit never dies!
   F#m          E
Farewell, I've gone,
   D                 C#
to take my throne above,
          F#m                E
but don't weep for me, 'cuz this will be
    D              C#
the labor of my love
 
[Chorus]
F#m      A               D       C#
Here we are, don't turn away now,
F#m         A             D             C#
we are the warriors that built this town.
F#m      A               D       C#
Here we are, don't turn away now,
F#m         A             D             C#
we are the warriors that built this town
     F#m
From dust
