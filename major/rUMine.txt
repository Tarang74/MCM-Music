[Verse 1]
 
         Em             G
I'm a puppet on a string
      C                Am
Tracy island, time-traveling diamond
Am     Em     G
Coulda shaped heartaches
        C              Am
Come to find ya fall in some velvet morning
Em          G
Years too late
                C              Am                  Em   G
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
      C                  Am
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
 
 
[Hook]
 
Em   G             C                     Am
I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
Am   Em     G       C                      Am
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
Am  Em      G
And I can't help myself
    C     Am                             Em   G  C   Am
All I      wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
 
 
        Em  G  C     Am
Are you mine?
        Em  G  C     Am
Are you mine?
        Em  G  C     Am
Are you mine?
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
(Am )        Em            G                 C
I guess what I'm trying to say is I need the deep end
     C   Am            Em        G         C
Keep imagining meeting, wished away entire lifetimes
  C   Am                  Em   G          C
Unfair we're not somewhere misbehaving for days
      C  Am               Em        G
Great escape lost track of time and space
               C              Am
She's a silver lining climbing on my desire
 
 
[Hook]
 
    Em    G          C                       Am
And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
Am   Em  G        C                       Am
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
Am   Em     G
And I can't help myself,
    C     Am                              Em    G   C     Am
All I      wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
 
 
        Em  G  C     Am
Are you mine?
        Em  G  C     Am
Are you mine?
        Em  G  C     Am
Are you mine?
C                        Am                        Em
    And the thrill of the chase moves in mysterious ways
      G
So in case I'm mistaken,
Am                    C             Am
I just wanna hear you say you got me baby
Am      Em   G  C     Am
Are you mine?
 
Em (AND MUTE)
She's a silver lining lone ranger riding through an open space
                                             Am
In my mind when she's not right there beside me
 
    Em   G           C                       Am
And I go crazy cause here isn't where I wanna be
Am  Em    G       C                      Am
And satisfaction feels like a distant memory
Am   Em     G
And I can't help myself,
    C     Am                             Em   G   C     Am
All I      wanna hear her say is "Are you mine?"
     Am      Em    G  C     Am
Well are you mine?
Am      Em    G  C     Am
Are you mine?
 
Are you mine?
