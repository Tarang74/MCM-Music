#Someone you loved

[Verse 1]
A                          E                              F#m    D
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to save me
A                            E                        F#m    D
This all or nothing really got a way of driving me crazy
                     A                 E                F#m               D
I need somebody to heal, somebody to know, somebody to have, somebody to hold
              A                      E
It's easy to say but it's never the same
                F#m                               D
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
 
 
[Chorus]
               A                E
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 F#m                       D
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  A                          E
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
                    F#m                        D
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Verse 2]
A                          E                               F#m    D
I'm going under and this time I fear there's no one to turn to
A                            E                           F#m    D
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
                         A                 E                F#m                        D
Now I need somebody to know, somebody to heal, somebody to have, just to know how it feels
              A                      E
It's easy to say but it's never the same
                F#m                            D
I guess I kinda liked the way you helped me escape
 
 
[Chorus]
               A                E
Now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 F#m                       D
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  A                          E
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
                    F#m                        D
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Bridge]
    Bm           F#m                 E
And I tend to close my eyes but it hurts sometimes
          F#m     Bm
I fall into your arms
         F#m                        E
I'll be safe in your sound 'til I come back around
 
 
[Chorus]
                   A                E
For now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 F#m                       D
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  A                          E
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
                    F#m                        D
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
                   A                E
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
                 F#m                       D
And you're not here to get me through it all
                  A                          E
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
                    F#m                        D
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
 
 
[Outro]
                  A                            E
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
                    F#m                        D     A
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
