#Sucker

[Verse 1]
            F#m  A  E
We go together
                        F#m         A   E  C#
Better than birds of a feather, you and me
              F#m     A   E
We change the weather... yeah
                      F#m                A      E
I'm feeling heat in December when you're 'round me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
             F#m            A           E
I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars
    F#m                   A           E        C#  E
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
           F#m             A            E
You're the medicine in the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
       F#m              A     E
And, baby, you know it's obvious
 
[Chorus]
                  F#m  Bm  E
I'm a sucker for you
             A                D             C#
You say the word and I'll go anywhere blindly
                  F#m  Bm  E
I'm a sucker for you... yeah
      A                D                      C#
Any road you take you know that you'll find me
                  F#m         Bm        E
I am a sucker for all the subliminal things
       A             D                    C#
No one knows about you (About you), 'bout you (About you)
           F#m        Bm        E
And you're making the typical me
         A         D
Break my typical rules
      C#
It's true
                  F#m  A  E
I'm a sucker for you... yeah
 
[Verse 2]
             F#m    A   E
Don't complicate it... yeah
                               F#m        A      E  C#  E
'Cause I know you and you know everything about me
         F#m     A   E
I can't remember
                          F#m                  A       E
All of the nights I don't remember when you're 'round me
 
[Pre-Chorus]
             F#m            A           E
I've been dancing on top of cars and stumbling out of bars
    F#m                   A           E        C#  E
I follow you through the dark, can't get enough
           F#m             A            E
You're the medicine in the pain, the tattoo inside my brain
       F#m              A     E
And, baby, you know it's obvious
 
[Chorus]
                  F#m  Bm  E
I'm a sucker for you
             A                D             C#

I'm a sucker for you... yeah
      A                D                      C#
Any road you take you know that you'll find me
                  F#m         Bm        E
I am a sucker for all the subliminal things
       A             D                    C#
No one knows about you (About you), 'bout you (About you)
           F#m        Bm        E
And you're making the typical me
         A         D
Break my typical rules
      C#
It's true
N.C.
I'm a sucker for you... yeah
