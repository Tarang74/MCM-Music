[Verse 1]
 
Em       F#m         G                    F#m
 She was more like a beauty queen, from a movie scene,
Em       F#m                  G            F#m      Am
 I said; don't mind, but what do you mean; I am the one?
                                    Em    F#m    G
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.
          F#m      Am                                      (Em)
She said; I am the one, who will dance on the floor, in the round.

[Verse 2]
 
Em           F#m          G                   F#m
 She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene.
Em          F#m               G                    F#m       Am
 Then every head turned, with eyes that dreamed of being the one,
                                   (Em)
Who will dance on the floor, in the round.

[Bridge 1]
 
C                          Em
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                               Em
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
    C                         Em
And mother always told me; be careful of who you love;
       C                                B
And be careful of what you do, 'cos the lie becomes the truth.
 
 
[Chorus 1]
 
Em      F#m     G      F#m
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
Em            F#m       G           F#m      Am
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
                      Em  F#m  , G
But the kid is not my son.
          F#m      Am                        (Em)
She says; I am the one, but the kid is not my son.

[Verse 3]
 
Em   F#m            G                         F#m
 For forty days and forty nights, the law was on her side.
Em           F#m               G          F#m             Am
 But who can stand, when she's in demand, her schemes and plans?
                                    Em    F#m  , G
'Cos we danced on the floor, in the round.
        F#m         Am                                   Em    F#m
So take my strong a-dvice; just remember to always think twice.
          G               F#m
(Do think twice, do think twice).
 
 
[Verse 3]
 
Em           F#m       G                            F#m
 She told my baby we'd danced 'till three, then she looked a me,
Em             F#m       G               F#m              Am
 Then showed a photo; my baby cried; his eyes looked like mine.
                                 Em          F#m    G    F#m
Go on dance on the floor, in the round, baby.
 
 
[Bridge 2]
 
C                          Em
 People always told me; be careful what you do;
          C                               Em
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts.
    C                                    Em
She came and stood right by me; then the smell of sweet perfume.
     C                           B
This happened much too soon; she called me to her room.
 
 
[Chorus 2]
 
Em      F#m     G      F#m
 Billie Jean is not my lover;
Em            F#m       G           F#m      Am
 She's just a girl who, claims that I am the one.
                      Em  F#m/E, G   F#m
But the kid is not my son.
