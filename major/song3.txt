Demons

[Verse 1]
          A
When the days are cold
         E
And the cards all fold
         F#m
And the saints we see
         D
Are all made of gold
           A
When your dreams all fail
         E
And the ones we hail
         F#m
Are the worst of all
         D
And the blood’s run stale
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
 I want to hide the truth
E                    F#m
 I want to shelter you
F#m
 But with the beast inside
D
 There’s nowhere we can hide
A
 No matter what we breed
E                         F#m
 We still are made of greed
F#m
This is my kingdom come
D
 This is my kingdom come
 
[Chorus]
A
 When you feel my heat
E
 Look into my eyes
F#m
 It’s where my demons hide
D
 It’s where my demons hide
A
 Don’t get too close
E
 It’s dark inside
F#m
 It’s where my demons hide
D
 It’s where my demons hide
 
[Verse 2]
          A
When the curtain’s call
        E
Is the last of all
          F#m
When the lights fade out
         D
All the sinners crawl
         A
So they dug your grave
         E
And the masquerade
           F#m
Will come calling out
        D
At the mess you made
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
Don’t wanna let you down
E
 But I am hellbound
F#m
 Though this is all for you
D
 Don’t wanna hide the truth
A
  No matter what we breed
E
 We still are made of greed
F#m
 This is my kingdom come
D
 This is my kingdom come
 
[Chorus]
A
 When you feel my heat
E
 Look into my eyes
F#m
 It’s where my demons hide
D
 It’s where my demons hide
A
 Don’t get too close
E
 It’s dark inside
F#m
 It’s where my demons hide
D
 It’s where my demons hide
 
[Verse 3]
A
  They say it's what you make
E
I say it's up to fate
F#m
 It's woven in my soul
D
 I need to let you go
A
 Your eyes, they shine so bright
E
 I want to save their light
F#m                    N.C.
 I can't escape this now
 
 Unless you show me how
 
[Chorus]
A
 When you feel my heat
E
 Look into my eyes
F#m
 It’s where my demons hide
D
 It’s where my demons hide
A
 Don’t get too close
E
 It’s dark inside
F#m
 It’s where my demons hide
D                      A
 It’s where my demons hide
