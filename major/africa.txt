[Verse 1]
B                   D#m     G#m
I hear the drums echoing tonight
B                 A             C#m         G#m   A G#m C#m
She hears only whispers of some quiet conversa - tion
B                 D#m           G#m
She's coming in, twelve thirty flight
B                 A                      C#m               G#m   A G#m C#m
The moonlit wings reflect the stars that guide me toward salva-tion
B              D#m             G#m
I stopped an old man along the way
B                   A              C#m              G#m   A G#m C#m
Hoping to find some old forgotten words or ancient melo-dies
B              D#m       G#m                  A                C#m
He turned to me as if to say “hurry boy, it's waiting there for you”
 
[Chorus]
F#m          D               A        E
Gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
F#m                     D             A               E
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
F#m          D           A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m             D               A              C#m E F#m
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...
    A G#m C#m
Ooo Ooo
    A G#m C#m
 
[Verse 2]
B             D#m            G#m
The wild dogs cry out in the night
B                     A                C#m      G#m   A G#m C#m
As they grow restless longing for some solitary compa-ny
B           D#m              G#m
I know that I must do what's right
B                      A          C#m               G#m    A G#m C#m
As sure as Kilimanjaro rises like Olympus above the Serengeti
B         D#m                G#m
I seek to cure what's deep inside
G#m                A                   C#m
Frightened of this thing that I've become
 
[Chorus]
     F#m          D               A        E
It’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
F#m                     D             A               E
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
F#m        D             A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m             D               A              C#m E F#m
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had...
    A G#m C#m
Ooo Ooo
    A G#m C#m

[Bridge]
B   D#   G#m                 A                  C#m
            “hurry boy, she's waiting there for you”
 
[Outro/Chorus]
     F#m          D               A        E
It’s gonna take a lot to drag me away from you
F#m                    D              A               E
There's nothing that a hundred men or more could ever do
F#m        D             A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m        D             A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m        D             A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m        D             A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m        D             A   E
I bless the rains down in  Africa
F#m             D               A              C#m E F#m
Gonna take some time to do the things we never had…
    A G#m C#m
Ooo Ooo
