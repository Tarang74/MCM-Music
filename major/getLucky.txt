[Intro]
 
 Am  C  Em  D 
 Am  C  Em  D 
 
 
[Verse]
 
[ D ]                     Am
   Like the legend of the phoenix
C                 Em
  All ends with beginnings
D                       Am
  What keeps the planet spinning
C                      Em        D
  The force from the beginning
 
 
[Pre-chorus]
 
Am             C
We've come too far
        Em        D
To give up who we are
   Am              C
So let's raise the bar
        Em          D
And our cups to the stars
 
 
[Chorus]
 
Am
 She's up all night till the sun
C
 I'm up all night to get some
Em
 She's up all night for good fun
D
 I'm up all night to get lucky
Am
 We're up all night till the sun

 We're up all night to get some

[Verse]
 
 
[ D ]                 Am
   The present has no ribbon
C                    Em
  Your gift keeps on giving
D                  Am
  What is this I'm feeling?
C                           Em        D
  If you want to leave, I'm with it
