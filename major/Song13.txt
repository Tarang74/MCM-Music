Not today

[Intro]
A

 
[Verse]
A
There she goes in front of me
                              D
Take my life and set me free again
                            A
We'll make a memory out of it
 
Holy road is at my back
                              D
Don't look on, take me back again
                            A
We'll make a memory out of it
 
[Pre-Chorus]
   F#m
We finally fall apart and we break each other's hearts
             D                                  E
If we wanna live young, love, we better start today
 
[Chorus]
               D          A           E
It's gotta get easier, oh easier somehow
 
Cause I'm falling, I'm falling
   D          A          E
Oh easier and easier somehow
 
Oh I'm calling, I'm calling
     D               A
And it isn't over unless it is over
E
I don't wanna wait for that
               F#m         E           D
It's gotta get easier, oh easier somehow
           A         D
But not today, not today
