F#m        E         A
  Tell me somethin' girl
D                       A       E
  Are you happy in this modern world?
F#m        E         A
    Or do you need more
D                              A         E
Is there somethin' else you're searchin' for?
 
[Refrain]
F#m E  A
I'm fallin'
D
 In all the good times
  A      E            F#m  E   A
I find myself longin'      for change

 And in the bad times I fear myself

F#m   E          A
Or do you need more
D                        A      E
Ain't it hard keepin' it so hardcore?

I'm falling

I'm off the deep end

I'll never meet the ground

Crash through the surface

We're far from the shallow now

We're far from the shallow now
