[Intro]
Em   G   D   A
Em   G   D   A
Em   G   D   A
Em   G   D   A
 
 
[Verse 1]
Em       G
Today is gonna be the day
              D                  A
That they're gonna throw it back to you
Em          G
By now you should've somehow
    D                A
Realised what you gotta do
 
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
 D           A                 C  D  A
Feels the way I do about you now
 
 
[Verse 2]
Em           G
Backbeat the word is on the street
          D                 A
That the fire in your heart is out
Em              G
I'm sure you've heard it all before
          D             A
But you never really had a doubt
Em                   G       D
I don't believe that anybody feels
           A                 Em  G  D  A
The way I do about you now
 
 
[Bridge]
     C                D            Em
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
     C                D                Em
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding
 C              D
There are many things that I would
G       D      Em
Like to say to you
       D      A
But I don't know how
 
 
[Chorus]
         C    Em  G
Because maybe
        Em                   C        Em  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
     Em   C  Em  G
And after all
                Em  C  Em  G   Em
You're my wonderwall
 
 
[Verse 3]
Em        G
Today was gonna be the day
             D                  A
But they'll never throw it back to you
Em         G
By now you should've somehow
    D                    A
Realised what you're not to do
Em                   G
I don't believe that anybody
D            A
Feels the way I do
           Em  G  D  A
About you now
 
 
[Bridge]
     C                  D              Em
And all the roads that lead you there are winding
     C                   D             Em
And all the lights that light the way are blinding
 C              D                  G       D      Em
There are many things that I would like to say to you
       D      A
But I don't know how
 
 
[Chorus]
        C    Em  G
I said maybe
        Em                   C        Em  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
     Em   C  Em  G
And after all
           Em   C   Em  G  Em
You're my wonderwall
        C             Em   G
I said maybe (I said maybe)
        Em                   C        Em  G
You're gonna be the one that saves me?
     Em   C  Em  G
And after all
           Em   C   Em  G  Em
You're my wonderwall
        C             Em   G
I said maybe (I said maybe)
        Em                   C               Em      G
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        Em                   C               Em      G
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
        Em                   C               Em      G  Em
You're gonna be the one that saves me? (that saves me)
