Just The Way You Are

[Intro]
 
A         F#m
Ah, ah ah ah
      D            A
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
  A
Oh her eyes, her eyes, make the stars look like they're not shining
F#m
 Her hair, her hair, falls perfectly without her trying
D                                        A
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
     A
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her she won't believe me
F#m
 And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
D                                             A
 But every time she asks me do I look okay, I say
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                A                   F#m
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              D                        A
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             A                      F#m
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                   D                        A
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are, (yeah)
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
A
 Her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
F#m
 Her laugh, her laugh, she hates but I think it's so sexy
D                                         A
 She's so beautiful, and I tell her every day
 
        A
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
   F#m
If perfect is what you're searching for, then just stay the same
D                                                            A
So, don't even bother asking if you look okay, you know I'll say
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                A                   F#m
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              D                        A
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             A                      F#m
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                   D                        A
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
 
 
[Interlude]
 
            A                F#m
The way you are, the way you are
             D                        A
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
 
 
[Chorus]
 
                A                   F#m
When I see your face, there's not a thing that I would change
              D                        A
Cause you're amazing, just the way you are
             A                      F#m
And when you smile, the whole world stops and stares for a while
                   D                        A
Cause girl you're amazing, just the way you are
