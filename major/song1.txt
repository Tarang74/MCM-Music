Bad Liar

[Intro]
A 
[Verse 1]
   A
Oh hush my dear, it's been a difficult year
    F#m
And terrors don't prey on innocent victims
D                 E                A
 Trust me darlin', trust me darlin' 
            A
It's been a loveless year
      A
I'm a man of three fears
  F#m
Integrity, faith and crocodile tears
D                 E                A
 Trust me darlin', trust me darlin'
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                  F#m
So look me in the eyes
                 D
Tell me what you see
            A
Perfect paradise
               E
Tearing at the seams
                 F#m
I wish I could escape it
                D
I don't want to fake it
                A
I wish I could erase it
                  N.C.
Make your heart believe
 
[Chorus]
                  F#m
But I'm a bad liar
        D
Bad liar
            A
Now you know
            E
Now you know
              F#m
I'm a bad liar
        D
Bad liar
            A
Now you know
               N.C.
You're free to go
 
[Verse 2]
    A
Did all my dreams never mean one thing
     F#m
Does happiness lie in a diamond ring
D
Oh I've been asking, for
E                           A
Oh I've been asking, for problems, problems, problems
 
[Verse 3]
  A
I wage my war, on the world inside
  F#m
I take my gun to the enemy's side
D
Oh I've been asking for (trust me darlin')
E                                              A
Oh I've been asking (trust me darlin'), for problems, problems, problems
 
[Pre-Chorus]
                  F#m
So look me in the eyes
                 D
Tell me what you see
            A
Perfect paradise
               E
Tearing at the seams
                 F#m
I wish I could escape it
                D
I don't want to fake it
                A
I wish I could erase it
                  N.C.
Make your heart believe
 
[Chorus]
                  F#m
But I'm a bad liar
        D
Bad liar
            A
Now you know
            E
Now you know
              F#m
I'm a bad liar
        D
Bad liar
            A
Now you know
               N.C.
You're free to go
 
[Bridge]
D
I can't breathe
E
I can't be
C#m                  F#m         E  D
I can't be what you want me to be
                             E
Believe me this one time, believe me
 
[Chorus]
              F#m
I'm a bad liar
        D
Bad liar
            A
Now you know
            E
Now you know
              F#m
I'm a bad liar
        D
Bad liar
            A
Now you know
               N.C.
You're free to go
