Call Me Maybe

[Intro]
A
 
 
[Verse 1]
A
I threw a wish in the well,
F#m
Don't ask me, I'll never tell
D
I looked to you as it fell,
E
and now you're in my way
A
I trade my soul for a wish,
F#m
pennies and dimes for a kiss
D
I wasn't looking for this,
E
but now you're in my way
A                                 F#m
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
D
Hot night, wind was blowin'
E
Where you think you're going, baby?
 
 
[Chorus]
A
Hey, I just met you,
E
and this is crazy,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
A
It's hard to look right,
E
at you baaaabeh,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
 
A
Hey, I just met you,
E
and this is crazy,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
A
And all the other boys,
E
try to chase me,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Verse 2]
A
You took your time with the call,
F#m
I took no time with the fall
D
You gave me nothing at all,
E
but still, you're in my way
A
I beg, and borrow and steal
F#m
Have foresight and it's real
D
I didn't know I would feel it,
E
but it's in my way
A                                 F#m
Your stare was holdin', ripped jeans, skin was showin'
D
Hot night, wind was blowin'
E
Where you think you're going, baby?
 
 
[Chorus]
A
Hey, I just met you,
E
and this is crazy,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
A
It's hard to look right,
E
at you baaaabeh,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
 
A
Hey, I just met you,
E
and this is crazy,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
A
And all the other boys,
E
try to chase me,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Bridge]
A
Before you came into my life
E
I missed you so bad
D
I missed you so bad
E
I missed you so, so bad
 
A
Before you came into my life
E
I missed you so bad
D
And you should know that
E
I missed you so, so bad
 
 
[Chorus]
A
It's hard to look right,
F#m
at you baaaabeh,
D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?

D
but here's my number,
E
so call me, maybe?
 
 
[Outro]
A
Before you came into my life
E
I missed you so bad
D
I missed you so bad
E
I missed you so so bad
 
A
Before you came into my life
E
I missed you so bad
D
And you should know that
E
So call me, maybe?
