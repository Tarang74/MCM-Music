[Intro]
 
A      F#m D
 
 
[Verse]
 
  A
I heard that you're settled down
        F#m
That you found a girl
          D
And you're married now
  A
I heard that your dreams came true
         F#m
Guess she gave you things
        D
I didn't give to you
   A
Old friend why are you so shy
        F#m
It ain't like you to hold back
  D
Or hide from life
 
 
[Bridge]
 
  E                           F#m                D
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
 
I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
    E
I'd hoped you'd see my face
    F#m                             D           E     D
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A                E                 F#m D
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
       A               E        F#m D
I wish nothing but the best for you too
      A           E        F#m        D
Don't forget me I beg I re-member you said
             A                 E                     F#m   D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead
             A                 E                     F#m   D
Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
 
 
[Verse]
 
A
 You'd know how time flies
    F#m
Only yesterday
       D
was the time of our lives
       A
We were born and raised
    A
In a summer haze
     F#m                    D
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
 
 
[Bridge]
 
  E                          F#m                D
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited but
D
I couldn't stay away I couldn't fight it
    E
I'd hoped you'd see my face
    F#m                            D           E     D
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over

Sometimes it lasts in love but sometimes it hurts in-stead, yeah
 
 
[Break]
 
E
Nothing compares no worries or cares
F#m
Regrets and mistakes their memories make
D
Who would have known how
       Bm    A          D    E
Bitter-sweet this would taste
