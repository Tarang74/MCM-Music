Thunder

[Verse 1]
A
Just a young gun with a quick fuse, I was uptight, wanna let loose
D
I was dreaming of bigger things, and wanna leave my own life behind
A
Not a yes sir, not a follower, fit the box, fit the mold
                   D
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number, I was lightning before the thunder 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
F#m
Thunder, thunder, thun-
D
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
 
[Chorus]
A
Thunder, feel the thunder, lightning and the thunder
F#m
Thunder, feel the thunder
D
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
A
Thunder, thunder 
 
[Verse 2]
A
Kids were laughing in my classes, while I was scheming for the masses
D
Who do you think you are? Dreaming 'bout being a big star
A
You say you're basic, you say you're easy, you're always riding in the back seat
D
Now I'm smiling from the stage while, you were clapping in the nose bleeds
 
[Pre-Chorus]
A
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
F#m
Thunder, thunder, thun-
D
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
 
[Chorus]

Thunder, feel the thunder, lightning and the thunder
F#m
Thunder, feel the thunder
D
Lightning and the thunder, thunder
