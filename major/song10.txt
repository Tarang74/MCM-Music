I bet my life

[VERSE]
F#m      E                  A              D
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
F#m      E                   A
I know I let you down, didn't I?
F#m      E                     A              D
So many sleepless nights where you were waiting up on me
F#m             E               A
Well I'm just a slave unto the night 
 
[PRE-CHORUS]
F#m                 E                  A                 D
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
F#m              E                 A
Remember when I broke you down to tears
F#m      E                  A             D
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
F#m        E                    A
I gave you hell through all the years
 
[CHORUS]
   A    D      A        D      A      D       A      E
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
A     D      A       D      A      D       A      E
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
 
[VERSE]
F#m        E                    A          D
I've been around the world but never in my wildest dreams
F#m             E             A
Would I come running home to you
F#m           E               A             D
I've told a million lies but now I tell a single truth
F#m             E           A
There's you in everything I do
 
[PRE-CHORUS]
F#m                 E                  A                 D
Now remember when I told you that's the last you'll see of me
F#m              E                 A
Remember when I broke you down to tears
F#m      E                  A             D
I know I took the path that you would never want for me
F#m        E                    A
I gave you hell through all the years
 
[CHORUS]
   A    D      A        D      A      D       A      E
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
A     D      A       D      A      D       A      E
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
 
[BRIDGE]
Bm  E   F#m E/G# A
 
Bm                      E
Don't tell me that I'm wrong 
                       F#m        E               A
I've walked that road before and left you on your own
    Bm                            E
And please believe them when they say
                          F#m         E/G#              A
That it's left for yesterday and the records that I've played
       Bm          E        A
Please forgive for all I've done
 
[CHORUS]
   A    D      A        D      A      D       A      E
So I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
A     D      A       D      A      D       A      E
I, I bet my life, I bet my life, I bet my life on you
