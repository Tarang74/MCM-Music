[Intro]
 A     D     F#m E      A
 

[Verse 1]
A
Something about the way that you walked into my living room
D
Casually and confident lookin' at the mess I am
    F#m          E                A
But still you, still you want me
A
Stress lines and cigarettes, politics and deficits
D
Late bills and overages, screamin' and hollerin'
    F#m         E                  A
But still you, still you want me
  
[Chorus]
A                     D
Oh, I always let you down
                        F#m
You're shattered on the ground
                     E
But still I find you there
        A
Next to me
    A                   D
And oh, stupid things I do
                        F#m
I'm far from good, it's true
                 E
But still I find you
        A
Next to me (next to me)
 
[Verse 2]
A
There's something about the way that you always see the pretty view
D
Overlook the blooded mess, always lookin' effortless
     F#m         E                 A
And still you, still you want me
A
I got no innocence, faith ain't no privilege
D
I am a deck of cards, vice or a game of hearts
    F#m         E                  A
And still you, still you want me
 
[Chorus]
A                     D
I'll always let you down
                        F#m
And shattered on the ground
                     E
But still I find you there
        A
Next to me
    A                   D
And all the stupid things I do
                        F#m
I'm far from good, it's true
                 E
Still I find you
        A
Next to me (next to me)
 
[Bridge]
A                          D
So thank you for taking a chance on me
                F#m    E
I know it isn't easy
                       A
But I hope to be worth it (oh)
   A                       D
So thank you for taking a chance on me
                 F#m   E
I know it isn't easy
                 A
But I hope to be worth it (oh)
 
[Chorus]
A                     D
I'll always let you down
                        F#m
And shattered on the ground
                     E
But still I find you there
        A
Next to me
    A                   D
And all the stupid things I do
                        F#m
I'm far from good, it's true
                 E
But still I find you
        A
