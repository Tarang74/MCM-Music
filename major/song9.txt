[Intro]
A E F#m D
[Verse 1]
A
I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
A
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
A
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
A
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
A
I remember walking in the cold of November
E
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
F#m
27 years and the end of my mind
D
But holding to the thought of another time
D
But looking to the ways at the ones before me
D
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
A
I don't want to hear about what to do
A
I don�t want to do it just to do it for you
 
[Chorus]
A
Hello, hello
                                       E
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
                                         F#m
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
                                          D
Like I�m empty and there's nothing really real, real I'm looking for a way out
A
Hello, hello
                                       E
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
                                        F#m
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
                                         D
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real I'm looking for a way out
 
[Verse 2]
A
I find it hard to tell you how I want to run away
A
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
A
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
A
Send me up, send me down, send me never demigod
A
I remember walkin� in the heat of the summer
E
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
F#m
27 years and I�ve nothing to show
D
Falling from the doves to the dark of the crow
D
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
D
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
A
I don't want to hear about what to do, no
A
I don�t want to do it just to do it for you 

Zero

[Chorus]
A
Hello, hello
                                       E

                                         F#m
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
                                          D
Like I�m empty and there's nothing really real, real I'm looking for a way out
A
Hello, hello
                                       E
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero

Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
                                         D
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real

I'm looking for a way out 

[Bridge]
A                        E
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
F#m                      D
Maybe you're the same as me
A                        E
Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it
F#m                             D
They say the truth will set you free
 
[Chorus]

                                          D
Like I�m empty and there's nothing really real, real I'm looking for a way out
