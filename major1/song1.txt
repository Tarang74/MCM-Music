Dont Start Now

[Intro]
F#m                   A      Bm
  If you don't wanna see me
 
 
[Verse 1]
N.C.           Bm      F#m
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
D                        A
Thinking 'bout the way I was
        E          Bm        F#m
Did the heartbreak change me, maybe
    D                     A  E
But look at where I ended up
 
        Bm                     F#m
I'm all good already, so moved on, it's scary
        D                    A   E
I'm not where you left me at all, so
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
F#m                    A                       Bm   D
   If you don't wanna see me dancin' with somebody
F#m                A                         Bm      D
   If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
 
 
[Chorus 1]
           Bm             F#m
Don't show up, don't come out
            D               A   E
Don't start caring about me now
      Bm            F#m
Walk away, you know how
            D               A
Don't start caring about me now
 
 
[Verse 2]
N.C.           Bm      F#m
Aren't you the guy who tried to
D                          A
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
          E         Bm     F#m
Though it took some time to survive you
    D                   A
I'm better on the other side
 
        Bm                     F#m
I'm all good already, so moved on, it's scary
        D                    A   E
I'm not where you left me at all, so
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
F#m                    A                       Bm   D
   If you don't wanna see me dancin' with somebody
F#m                A                         Bm      D
   If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
 
 
[Chorus 2]
           Bm             F#m
Don't show up, don't come out
            D               A   E
Don't start caring about me now
      Bm            F#m
Walk away, you know how
            D               A
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now, 'bout me)
 
 
[Bridge]
Bm         F#m
   Up, up, don't come out, out, out
D
Don't show up, don't show up, up
A             E
  Don't start now (oh)
 
Bm         F#m
   Up, up, don't come out, out
        D                    A   E
I'm not where you left me at all, so
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 3]
F#m                    A                       Bm   D
   If you don't wanna see me dancin' with somebody
F#m                A                         Bm      D
   If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
 
 
[Chorus 3]
           F#m                             A
Don't show up (don't show up), don't come out (don't come out)
            Bm              D
Don't start caring about me now ('bout me now)
      F#m                        A
Walk away (walk away), you know how (you know how)
            Bm              D
Don't start caring about me now (so)
 
 
[Outro]
F#m         A
   Up, up, don't come out, out, out
Bm
Don't show up, don't show up, up
D
Walk away, walk away (so)
 
F#m         A
   Up, up, don't come out, out, out
Bm
Don't show up, don't show up, up
D
Walk away, walk away, oh
