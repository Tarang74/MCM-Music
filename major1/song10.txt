A
You're a good soldier

Choosing your battles
F#m
Pick yourself up
                  D
And dust yourself off
And back in the saddle
 
A
You're on the frontline
E
Everyone's watching
F#m
You know it's serious
              D
We're getting closer
This isnt over
 
A
The pressure is on
E
You feel it
F#m
But you've got it all
D
Believe it

When you fall get up
Oh oh...

And if you fall get up
Eh eh...
