#Everything I wanted

[Verse 1]
D         E
I had a dream
C#m                 D
I got everything I wanted
D              E
Not what you think
C#m               D
And if I'm being honest
                       D        E
It might have been a nightmare
               C#m       D
To anyone who might care
D                E
Thought I could fly
C#m                   D
So I stepped off the Golden
D        E
Nobody cried
 C#m         D
Nobody even noticed
                    D            E
I saw them standing right there
                    C#m        D
Kinda thought they might care
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D         E
I had a dream
C#m                 D
I got everything I wanted
    D              E
But when I wake up I see
C#m        D
You're with me
        D
And you say
 
 
[Chorus]
            E
As long as I'm here
C#m        D
No one can hurt you
D            E
Don't wanna lie here
C#m          D
But you can learn to
D            E
If I could change
    C#           D
The way that you see yourself
D                    E
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
C#m          D
"They don't deserve you"
 
 
[Verse 2]
D            E
I tried to scream
C#m                   D
But my head was under water
D               E
They called me weak
C#m                           D
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
                  D        E
Could've been a nightmare
                            C#m         D
But it felt like they were right there
       D                           E
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
   C#m                  D
But I don't wanna let anybody know
        D                        E
Cause everybody wants something from me now
   C#m                 D
And I don't wanna let 'em down
 
[Pre-Chorus]
D         E
I had a dream
C#m                 D
I got everything I wanted
    D              E
But when I wake up I see
C#m        D
You're with me
        D
And you say
 
 
[Chorus]
            E
As long as I'm here
C#m        D
No one can hurt you
D            E
Don't wanna lie here
C#m          D
But you can learn to
D            E
If I could change
    C#           D
The way that you see yourself
D                    E
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
C#m          D
"They don't deserve you"
 
[Bridge]
D                 E
If I knew it all then
               C#m
Would I do it again
               D
Would I do it again
D                       E
If they knew what they said
                        C#m
Would go straight to my head
                     D
What would they say instead
 
D                 E
If I knew it all then
               C#
Would I do it again
               D
Would I do it again
D                       E
If they knew what they said
                        C#m
Would go straight to my head
                      D
What would they say instead
