#I don't care

[Verse 1]
A
  I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
                                      F#m
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
 
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
                               D
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
                       E
Then you take my hand, finish my drink, say, "shall we dance?"
     A
Hell yeah, you know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
 
You make it better like that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
A
  Don't think I fit in at this party
F#m
     Everyone's got so much to say, yeah
D                          E
  I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
A
  Who wants to fit in anyway?
 
 
[Chorus 1]
               A
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
                       F#m
All the bad things disappear
 
And you're makin' me feel like maybe I am somebody
D
  I can deal with the bad nights
E                          A
  When I'm with my baby, yeah, ooh ooh-ooh ooh oooh ooh
 
               A
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
                   F#m
You can take me anywhere
 
And you're makin' me feel like I'm loved by somebody
D
  I can deal with the bad nights
E                          A
  When I'm with my baby, yeah, ooh ooh-ooh ooh oooh ooh
 
 
[Verse 2]
N.C.
     We at a party we don't wanna be at
A                                 F#m
  Tryna talk but we can't hear ourselves
 
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
                                      D
With all these people all around, I'm crippled with anxiety
        E
But I'm told, it's where we're s'posed to be
         A
You know what, it's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
 
And you make it better like that
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
A
  Don't think we fit in at this party
F#m
     Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah yeah
D                               E
  When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm-mm
A                                N.C.
  But now I think that we should stay
 
 
[Chorus 2]
               A
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
                       F#m
All the bad things disappear
 
And you're makin' me feel like maybe I am somebody
D

E                          A
  When I'm with my baby, yeah, ooh ooh-ooh ooh oooh ooh

               A
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
                   F#m
You can take me anywhere
 
And you're makin' me feel like I'm loved by somebody
D
  I can deal with the bad nights
E                          A
  When I'm with my baby, yeah, ooh ooh-ooh ooh oooh ooh (no)
