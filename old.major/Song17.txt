Since U Been Gone

[Verse 1]
A
Here's the thing
We started out friends
F#m
 It was cool, but it was all pretend
A                               F#m
 Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
A                           Bm
 You dedicated, you took the time
F#m
 Wasn't long, till I called you mine
A                               F#m
 Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
                   A
And all you'd ever hear me say
                  F#m
Is how I pictured me with you
                      A
That's all you'd ever hear me say
A                       C# D
 But since you been gone
 
[Chorus]
 
A             C#       D         A

I'm so movin' on, yeah yeah
            Bm        F#m          E

Bm                  A
 Since you been gone
 
[Verse 2]
A
 How can I put it, you put me on
F#m
 I even fell for that stupid love song
A                               F#m
 Yeah, yeah, since you been gone
                   A
How come I'd never hear you say
             F#m
I just wanna be with you
                A
Guess you never felt that way
                       C# D
But since you been gone
 
[Chorus]

D                   F#m
 You had your chance, you blew it

 Out of sight, out of mind
D
 Shut your mouth, I just can't take it
                                   C# D
Again and again and again and again
