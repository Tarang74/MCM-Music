[Verse 1]
                        D
Thought I'd end up with Sean
                C#
But he wasn't a match
                       F#m
Wrote some songs about Ricky
                 A
Now I listen and laugh
                D
Even almost got married

And for Pete, I'm so thankful

Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
                 A
'Cause he was an angel
 
[Pre-Chorus]
              D
One taught me love
              C#
One taught me patience
                  F#m
And one taught me pain
             A
Now, I'm so amazing
                    D
I've loved and I've lost
                    C#
But that's not what I see
                F#m
So, look what I got
              A
Look what you taught me
                D
And for that, I say
 
[Chorus]

I ain't worried 'bout nothin'

I'll be thanking my dad
