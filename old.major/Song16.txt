The Middle

[Verse 1]
D             A               E
Take a seat right over there, sat on the stairs
D                A                  E
Stay or leave, the cabinets are bare and I'm unaware
     D                   A          E
Of just how we got into this mess, got so aggressive
 D                     A      E
I know we meant all good intentions
 
[Pre-Chorus]
            D
So pull me closer
                        A  E
Why don't you pull me close?
                       D
Why don't you come on over?
                      A E
I can't just let you go
 
[Chorus]
  D  A               E                    D
Oh baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m    E               D
I'm losing my mind just a little
    F#m             E                    D
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
         A E
In the middle
D   A             E                  D
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m   E                D
I'm losing my mind just a little
      A           E                  D
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m E
In the middle
 
[Verse]
D            A                  E
Take a step back for a minute, into the kitchen
D
Floors are wet
A                         E
Taps are still running, dishes are broken
D                      A                E
How did we get into this mess? Got so aggressive
D               F#m          E
I know we meant all good intentions
 
[Pre-Chorus]
            D
So pull me closer
                        A  E
Why don't you pull me close?
 
                       D
Why don't you come on over?
                      A E
I can't just let you go
 
[Chorus]
D   A             E                  D
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m   E                 D
I'm losing my mind just a little
      A           E                  D
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m  E
In the middle
 
[Bridge]
Bm             A         D
Looking at you, I can't lie
                    A
Just pouring out admission
                 E
Regardless my objection
Bm           A          D
And it's not about my pride
                  F#m
I need you on my skin
                         E
Just come over, pull me in, just
 
[Chorus]
D     A                  E               D
Oh, baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle
       A       E       D
I'm losing my mind just a little
    A            E             D
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
          A  E
In the middle, no no
D     A             E                  D
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m   E                 D
I'm losing my mind just a little
      A           E                  D
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m  E
In the middle
D      A             E                  D
Baby, why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m   E                 D
I'm losing my mind just a little
      A           E                  D
So why don't you just meet me in the middle?
       F#m    E
In the middle, middle
