Circles

[Intro]
A             D      Dm
 
A                D            A
Hey, hey, hey, hey
 
             D     Dm
Oh,  oh  oh,  oh-oh
           A
Oh, oh oh, oh-oh
           D           A
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
 
 
[Verse 1]
A*                D*
We couldn't turn around
                    A*
'Til we were upside down
                     D*
I'll be the bad guy now
                      A
But no, I ain't too proud
                   D        Dm
I couldn't be there
               A
Even when I try
                    D
You don't believe it
N.C.
We do this every time
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Seasons change and our love went cold
D                        Dm
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
A
Run away but we're running in circles
D          Dm
Run away, run away
              A
I dare you to do something
               D      Dm
I'm waiting on you   again, so I don't take the blame
A
Run away but we're running in circles
D          Dm
Run away, run away, run away, oh
 
 
[Verse 2]
A*
Let go
                          D*
I got a feeling that it's time to let go
A*
I say so
                         D*
I knew that this was due from the get go
                        A
You thought that it was special, special
                    D                   Dm
But it was just the sex though, the sex though
                     A
And I still hear the echoes (The echoes)
                          D                  N.C.
I got a feeling that it's time to let it go, let it go
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Seasons change and our love went cold
D                        Dm
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
A
Run away but we're running in circles
D         Dm
Run away, run away
              A
I dare you to do something
               D      Dm
I'm waiting on you   again, so I don't take the blame
A
Run away but we're running in circles
D         Dm
Run away, run away, run away
 
 
[Bridge]
A
Maybe you don't understand what I'm going through
D            Dm
It's only me,   what you got to lose?
A
Make up your mind, tell me what are you gonna do
D             Dm
It's only me,   let it go
 
 
[Chorus]
 
A
Seasons change and our love went cold
D                         Dm
Feed the flame 'cause we can't let it go
A
Run away but we're running in circles
D          Dm
Run away, run away
              A
I dare you to do something
               D      Dm
I'm waiting on you again, so I don't take the blame
A
Run away but we're running in circles
D         Dm                A
Run away, run away, run away
