                            F#m    E
When you told me that you'd love me
                      A     D
Was I a fool to believe in you?
         E              F#m E
When you told me I was special

I don't wanna say, "I miss you"
                         A           D
If I don't know that you miss me back (Oh no, no)

I don't wanna say the wrong thing
                    A         D
If I do, there's no coming back
