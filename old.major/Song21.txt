Watermelon Sugar

[Verse 1]
               Bm
   Tastes like strawberries
        F#m
   On a summer evening
A                            E
   And it sounds just like a song
          Bm
   I want more berries
            F#m
   And that summer feeling
A                        E
   It's so wonderful and warm
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
           Bm             F#m
Breathe me in, breathe me out
        A                           E
I don't know if I could ever go without
         Bm           F#m
I'm just thinking out loud
        A                           E
I don't know if I could ever go without
 
 
[Chorus]
                 Bm
