Lose You To Love Me

[Verse 1]
A                                   Bm
  You promised the world and I fell for it
F#m                                       E            A
   I put you first and you adored it, set fires to my forest
                   Bm                     F#m
And you let it burn, sang off-key in my chorus
                       E
'Cause it wasn't yours
 
A                          Bm
  I saw the signs and I ignored it
F#m                                        E           A
   Rose-colored glasses all distorted, set fire to my purpose
                 Bm                     F#m
And I let it burn, you got off on the hurtin'
                     E
When it wasnâ€™t yours, yeah
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
D                 A
  We'd always go into it blindly
E              A
  I needed to lose you to find me
D                   A
  This dancing was killing me softly
E
  I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
 
 
[Chorus 1]
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E                  A
To love, yeah, I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E
To love, yeah, I needed to lose you to love me
 
 
[Verse 2]
A                             Bm
  I gave my all and they all know it
F#m
   That you turned me down and now it's showing
N.C.
In two months, you replaced us
 
A               Bm
  Like it was easy
                   F#m
Made me think I deserved it
                        E
In the thick of healing, yeah
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
D                 A
  We'd always go into it blindly
E              A
  I needed to lose you to find me
D                   A
  This dancing was killing me softly
E
  I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
 
 
[Chorus 2]
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E                  A
To love, yeah, I needed to lose you to love me, yeah
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E
To love, yeah, I needed to lose you to love me
 
 
[Verse 3]
A                                   Bm
  You promised the world and I fell for it
F#m                                       E            A
   I put you first and you adored it, set fires to my forest
                   Bm                     F#m
And you let it burn, sang off-key in my chorus
 
 
[Chorus 3]
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E                  A
To love, yeah, I needed to hate you to love me, yeah
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E
To love, yeah, I needed to lose you to love me
 
 
[Outro]
D                        A
  To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E                 A                    D
To love, yeah, and now the chapter is closed and done
                       A
To love love, yeah, to love love, yeah
         E                                             D  A  E
To love, yeah, and now it's goodbye, it's goodbye for us
