There's a time that I remember, when I did not know no pain
       D              A              D                    E
When I believed in forever, and everything would stay the same
       A                 E                F#m           C#m
Now my heart feel like December, when somebody say your name
         D                  A               D               E
'Cause I can't reach out to call you, but I know I will one day, ayy
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
A      E                     F#m             C#m
  Everybody hurts sometimes, everybody hurts someday, ayy-ayy
D          A                      D                    E
  But everything gon' be alright, go and raise a glass and say, ayy
 
 
[Chorus 1]
A                  E
Here's to the ones that we got
F#m                C#m
Cheers to the wish you were here but you're not
           D                 A
'Cause the drinks bring back all the memories
   D                E
Of everything we've been through
 
A                 E

F#m               C#m
Toast to the ones that we lost on the way
           D                 A

There's a time that I remember, when I never felt so lost
       D               A               D            E
When I felt all of the hatred, was too powerful to stop (ooh yeah)
       A                  E               F#m             C#m
Now my heart feel like an ember, and it's lighting up the dark
        D                A               D            E
I'll carry these torches for ya, and you know I never drop, yeah
