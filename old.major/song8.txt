Blinding Lights

[Intro]
Em  Bm  D  A
 
 
[Verse 1]
                Em
I've been tryna call
                Bm
I've been on my own for long enough
              D                       A
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
                      Em
I'm going through withdrawals
               Bm
You don't even have to do too much
                D                       A
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 1]
                  Em                            Bm
I look around and,   Sin City's cold and empty (oh)
                             D
No one's around to judge me (oh) 
                                N.C.
I can't see clearly when you're gone
 
 
[Chorus 1]
        Em       Bm
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   D                                  A
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch
        Em       Bm
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
   D                                   A
Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust (hey, hey, hey)
Em  Bm  D  A
 
 
[Verse 2]
                   Em
I'm running out of time
                     Bm
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
             D                    A
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh-oh oh-oh oh
 
 
[Pre-Chorus 2]
Em                            Bm
   The city's cold and empty (oh)
                             D
No one's around to judge me (oh)
                                N.C.
I can't see clearly when you're gone
 
 
[Chorus 2]
        Em       Bm
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   D                                  A
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch
        Em       Bm
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
   D                                   A
Oh when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
 
 
[Bridge]
                 Em
I'm just walking by to let you know (by to let you know)
            Bm
I can never say it on the phone (say it on the phone)
     D                      A
Will never let you go this time (ooh)
 
 
[Chorus 3]
        Em       Bm
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   D                                  A
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch, hey, hey, hey
Em  Bm  D  A
             Hey, hey, hey
Em  Bm  D  A
 
 
[Outro]
        Em       Bm
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
   D                                  A
No I can't sleep here 'til I feel your touch
