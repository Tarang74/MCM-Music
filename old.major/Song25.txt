Hotline Bling

[Hook]
                          A         F#m
You used to call me on my cell phone

Late night when you need my love
               A         F#m

                    A          F#m
I know when that hotline bling
               C#m
That can only mean one thing
                    A          F#m
I know when that hotline bling
               C#m
That can only mean one thing
 
 
[Verse 1]
                          A     F#m
Ever since I left the city you
                      C#m
Got a reputation for yourself now
                         A          F#m
Everybody knows and I feel left out
                                  C#m
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
                                  A     F#m
Cause ever since I left the city, you
                             C#m
Started wearing less and goin' out more
                              A             F#m
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
                                  C#m
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before

[Verse 2]
                          A               F#m
Ever since I left the city, you, you, you
                         C#m
You and me we just don't get along
                        A             F#m
You make me feel like I did you wrong
                         C#m
Going places where you don't belong
                           A      F#m
Ever since I left the city, you
                          C#m
You got exactly what you asked for
                               A       F#m
Running out of pages in your passport
                                    C#m
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before

[Verse 3]
 
These days, all I do is
A                             F#m
Wonder if you bendin' over backwards for someone else
A                             F#m
Wonder if you rolling up a backwoods for someone else
A                                   F#m
Doing things I taught you gettin' nasty for someone else
C#m
You don't need no one else
C#m                          A
You don't need nobody else, no
                F#m
Why you never alone
                        A
Why you always touching road
                        F#m
Used to always stay at home, be a good girl
                C#m
You was in the zone
                   C#m
You should just be yourself
                           C#m
Right now, you're someone else
