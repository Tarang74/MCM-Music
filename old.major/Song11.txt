Sweet But Psycho

[Chorus]
 
D                        A
Oh, she's sweet but a psy-cho
                E
A little bit psy-cho
 
At night she screamin'
F#m                  E
"I'm outta my-my, my mind"
D                      A
Oh, she's hot but a psy-cho
                       E
So left but she's right though
 
At night she's screamin'
F#m                  E
"I'm outta my-my, my mind"
 
 
[Verse 1]
 
D                   A                   E
  She make you curse, but she's your blessing
                     F#m E
She'll rip your shirt    within a second
D                      A          E
  You'll be coming back, back for seconds
               F#m   E
With your plate, you just can't help it
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
 
D   A                E
No, no, you'll play alo-o-ong
                 F#m   E
Let her lead you o-o-on
                   D   A                   E
You'll be saying, "No, no", then saying, "Yes, yes, yes"
                     F#m           E
'Cause she's messin' with your head
 
 
[Chorus]

"I'm outta my-my, my mind"
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
 
D                     A
Grab a cop gun, kinda crazy
                 E
She's poison but tasty
 
Yeah, people say,
F#m         E
"Run, don't walk away"
D                        A
Cuz she's sweet but a psy-cho
                E
A little bit psy-cho
 
At night she screamin'
F#m                  E
"I'm outta my-my, my mind"
 
 
[Verse 2]
 
D                  A                    E
  See, someone said, "Don't drink her potions"
                     F#m     E
She'll kiss your neck   with no emotions
D                A                  E
  When she's mean, you know you love it
                     F#m         E
'Cause she tastes so sweet, don't sugar coat it
