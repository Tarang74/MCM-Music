[Verse]
 
 Am                                          Am  D  E    D
    It might seem crazy what I'm about to say
 Am                                          Am  D  E    D
    Sunshine she's here,  You can take a break
          Am                                    Am  D  E    D
    I'm a hot air balloon, That could go to space
             Am                                     Am  D  E    D
    With the air, Like I don't care,  Baby by the way

  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel, Like a room without a roof
                F                Em                   Em              A
  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel like, Happiness is the truth
                F                Em                   Em            A
  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you know what, Happiness is to you
                F                Em                 Em                     A
  Because I'm happy, Clap along, If you feel like, That's what you want to do
