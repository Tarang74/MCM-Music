How Do You Sleep

[Intro]
Dm   C   F   G Am   C G   Em
 
 
[Verse 1]
Dm                  C         F      G
  I'm done hating myself for feeling
Am                  C      G     Em
  I'm done crying myself awake
Dm                      C        F       G
  I've gotta leave and start the healing
             Am                     C         G
But when you move like that, I just want to stay
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
    Em     Dm          C
But what have I become? I'm
F                               G
Looking through your phone now, oh now
Am                C       G
   Love to you is just a game
Em     Dm             C
Look what I have done, I'm
F                       G
Dialing up the numbers on you
Am                  C          G
   I don't want my heart to break
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.  Dm                                C
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
F                              G
All that shame and all that danger
Am                              C        G
  I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
  Em Dm                                C
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
F                            G
All that fear and all that pressure
Am                              C        G
  I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
N.C.               Dm   C   F   G Am
Tell me how do you
           C        G
Love will keep you up tonight
             Em
Tell me how do you
 
 
[Verse 2]
Dm                 C        F        G
  Oh no, how did I manage to lose me?
   Am                              C G    Em
I am not this desperate, not this crazy
Dm                            C          F      G
  There's no way I'm stickin' 'round to find out
        Am                      C      G
I won't lose like that, I won't lose myself
 
 
[Pre-Chorus]
     Em  Dm             C
Look what   I have done, I'm
F                       G
Dialing up the numbers on you
Am                  C          G
   I don't want my heart to break
 
 
[Chorus]
N.C.  Dm                                C
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?
F                              G
All that shame and all that danger
Am                              C        G
  I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
  Em Dm                                C
Baby, how do you sleep when you lie to me?

All that fear and all that pressure
Am                              C        G
  I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight
 
 
[Post-Chorus]
N.C.               Dm   C   F   G Am
Tell me how do you
           C        G
Love will keep you up tonight
        Em        Dm   C   F   G Am
Tell me how do you
           C        G
Love will keep you up tonight

  I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight

  I'm hoping that my love will keep you up tonight (Tell me how do you)
