New Rules

[Intro]
Am
One, one, one...
 
[Verse 1]
Am
Talkin' in my sleep at night
              F
Makin' myself crazy
F
(Out of my mind, out of my mind)
Am
Wrote it down and read it out
Hopin' it would save me
F
(Too many times, too many times)
Am
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else
F
Nobody else
Am
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
F
I tell myself
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am
One, don't pick up the phone
F                             G
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Am
Two, don't let him in
F                        G
You'll have to kick him out again
Am
Three, don't be his friend
F                                 G
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
Am                       F                  G
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him
 
[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                  G
I gotta tell them to myself
Am
F                 G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                 G
I gotta tell them to myself
 
[Verse 2]
Am
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
F
(Nowhere to turn) no way
(Nowhere to turn) no
Am
Now I'm standing back from it, I finally see the pattern
F
(I never learn, I never learn)
Am
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself
I tell myself
F
I do, I do, I do
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am
One, don't pick up the phone
F                             G
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Am
Two, don't let him in
F                        G
You'll have to kick him out again
Am
Three, don't be his friend
F                                 G
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
Am                       F                  G
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him
 
[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                  G
I gotta tell them to myself
Am
F                 G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                 G
I gotta tell them to myself
 
[Bridge]
Am
Practice makes perfect
F                G
I'm still tryna' learn it by heart
(I got new rules, I count 'em)
Am
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
F               G
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I
Am
(I got new, I got new, I...)
 
[Pre-Chorus]
Am
One, don't pick up the phone
F                             G
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Am
Two, don't let him in
F                        G
You'll have to kick him out again
Am
Three, don't be his friend
F                                 G
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
Am                       F                  G
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him
 
[Chorus]
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                  G
I gotta tell them to myself
Am
F                 G
I got new rules, I count 'em
Am
F                 G
I gotta tell them to myself
 
[Outro]
Am
Don't let him in, don't let him in
F               G
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Am
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
F               G
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Am
Don't let him in, don't let him in
F               G
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Am
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
F               G
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Am
You gettin' over him
